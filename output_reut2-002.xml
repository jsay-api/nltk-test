		<subject>ENZON <ENZN> SAYS DRUG TREATS DISEASE</subject>
		<sentence>Enzon Inc said a newtreatment using its investigational new drug PEG-ADA hasrestored the functioning of the immune system in the first twochildren that were born deficient in the enzyme adenosinedeaminase.</sentence>
		<sentence>The disorder is known as severe combined immunodeficiencydisease, or "bubble boy disease"    Bubble Boy Disease is a rare but severe disease thathampers the development of the immune system.</sentence>
		<sentence>It has killedmost of its victims before adulthood.</sentence>
		<sentence>Children with the disease are consigned to live in asterile environment, such as a plastic bubble, to avoidinfection, the company said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The study of Enzon's drug, conducted at Duke University,showed that two children suffering from the disease weretreated for 11 and seven months, respectively, and were free ofserious infection during that time, the company said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Theresults were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</sentence>
		<sentence>The disease is caused by a missing enzyme, called AdenosineDeaminase, or ADA, that is crucial to the development of theimmune system.</sentence>
		<sentence>Enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzymewith a substance called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, serving todisguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body,preventing rejection.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune functionoccurred in each child, along with an increase in the number ofT-lymphocytes, the immune cells that were missing beforetreatment with PEG-ADA had begun," the study said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The children are now more active and have begun to gainweight and height.</sentence>
		<sentence>Before treatment their growth had been verypoor in comparison to normal children of the same age," thestudy, conducted by Doctors Michael Hershfield and RebeccaBuckley, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The PEG-ADA injections were given once a week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Victims ofthe disease have traditionally been treated by bone marrowtransplants, but for most, donors are not available ortransplantation is unsuccessful, the company said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Otherdiseases caused by a missing enzyme might also be treated byintroducing a PEG coated enzyme, the article noted.</sentence>

		<subject>CONGRESS MAY CURB U.S. AID TO DEVELOPMENT BANKS</subject>
		<sentence>Congressional ire is rising againstthe multinational development banks which make loans to helpother countries produce goods in direct competition withbeleagured U.S. farmers and miners.</sentence>
		<sentence>With a record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs lastyear and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressingto hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and otherdevelopment banks if the money is used to subsidize productionor to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.</sentence>
		<sentence>"American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreignagriculture and mineral production that is often in directcompetition with our producers," Senator Don Nickles, anOklahoma Republican, said in a letter to fellow senatorsseeking support for his legislation to limit these loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nickles and Senator Steven Symms, a conservative Republicanfrom Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictlylimit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if theymake any loans to help developing countries produce surpluscommodities or minerals.</sentence>
		<sentence>Current law requires that the United States vote againstsuch loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimatelyapproved by the banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raisedat two Senate committee hearings last week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on ForeignOperations, "As a policy matter, we oppose loans for productionof commodities in oversupply."</sentence>
		<sentence>The senators cited a 350-mln-dlr World Bank loan made toArgentina last year to help it increase its agriculturalexports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans suchas a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestockexports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 atlow interest rates for agriculture.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted threetimes over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>But even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal,the restrictions were weakened in the final version.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only aprovision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval clearedCongress.</sentence>
		<sentence>This year's version, called the Foreign AgriculturalInvestment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to voteagainst loans designed to increase production of surpluscommodities and minerals.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also, the recipient countries wouldhave to prove that the production, marketing and export of thecommodities could be handled without government subsidy.</sentence>
		<sentence>If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the UnitedStates would not increase or replenish funds for thatinstitution until it agrees to stop making such loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Objections to such loans have most often been raised byconservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.funding for these international development banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raisedsimilar concerns among more moderate senators.</sentence>
		<sentence>The administration opposes any legislation that would tieits hands in votes on the loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>It argues there might beinstances in which a country needed the money to continue itsmoves toward U.S. policies in other areas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Baker said the United States would continue to use itsleverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalizationmeasures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.</sentence>
		<sentence>Two House Republicans, Representatives Larry Craig of Idahoand Beau Bolter of Texas, have introduced the bill.</sentence>
		<sentence>But itfaces stiff opposition in the House Banking Committee which hasblocked its consideration by the House in the past.</sentence>
		<sentence>Symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to anyrelated legislation this year, an aide said.</sentence>

		<subject>ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL U.S. EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER</subject>
		<sentence>Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS> earningsfor 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult marketconditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due todifferent accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year,while the additional effect of currency movements reduced thecontribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg.</sentence>
		<sentence>The group earlier reported a drop in net income for theyear to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, withlower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales byvolume.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless atthe top end of market forecasts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Shell Transport and TradingPlc <SC.L> shares, the U.K.</sentence>
		<sentence>Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stgfrom a close last night of 11.06 stg.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts noted that ageneral collapse in exploration and production volumes waspartially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mlnstg from 205 mln in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expectedcurrency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarterresults, which was the main reason for the figures exceedingforecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de ZoeteWedd noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, he added there could well be a sharp fall inperformance in the first quarter of 1987, due to theimprobability that the group would be able to repeat the highrefining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>The impact of recovering oil prices would come throughfaster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such ahigh proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, whichtypically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-yearlag, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the thirdquarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit inthe period, with Shell Oil being one of them.</sentence>
		<sentence>The decrease inU.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the grouphad increased share to become volume market leader, Holmesadded.</sentence>
		<sentence>Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdueU.S. Exploration activity.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Exploration is currently prettyflat.</sentence>
		<sentence>We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be nomassive upturn," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the NorthSea and the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Ifyou are not exploring you are not going to find anything," henoted.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayedbelow 20 dlrs a barrel.</sentence>

		<subject>BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE</subject>
		<sentence>Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain'sdecision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savingsbanks, saying it reflected the socialist government'sdetermination not to ease up in the fight against inflationdespite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.</sentence>
		<sentence>The central bank last night raised the requirement by onepercentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excessliquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by theBank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates tochoke off money supply growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think it's a good measure," a senior foreign banker said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest ratesand avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy."</sentence>
		<sentence>"It shows that the political will is very strong.</sentence>
		<sentence>They knowthat controlling inflation will make industry more competitiveand bring down unemployment in the long run," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The head of another foreign bank said that only a monthago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a risein reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy ofraising interest rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting moneyfrom abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanishexports less competitive.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government says industry's competitiveness is alsobeing hit hard by inflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>At 8.3 pct last year, the rate wasway above that of Spain's major trading partners in theEuropean Community, which it joined a year ago.</sentence>
		<sentence>To help meet this year's target of five pct, it isinsisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage forclashes with trade unions, who say they have made enoughsacrifices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whosedemands essentially involve more government spending, havebecome an almost daily occurrence.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Prime Minister FelipeGonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could havesome impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit themoney market too hard.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its keyovernight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged attoday's auction.</sentence>
		<sentence>The rate has been increased nine times sincethe start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise inany case with the end of the six pct maximium interest ratebanks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.</sentence>
		<sentence>The measure will take effect tomorrow, following thepublication of the decree in today's official gazette.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankerssay the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,inevitably, push lending rates higher.</sentence>
		<sentence>A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds whichbanks must invest in specific areas, also takes effecttomorrow.</sentence>

		<sentence>Officials and diplomats said EC farmministers, who earlier this week ended another marathonnegotiating session, achieved more than ever before in thefight to end food surpluses, and delighted EC officials are nowpreparing to carry the reform offensive into other areas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Their immediate aim is to drain the wine and olive oil"lakes" and level the "grain mountain" that have brought theCommunity so much unwelcome publicity.</sentence>
		<sentence>Earlier this week, ministers finally agreed after 36 hoursof negotiations the fine details of an outline accord to cutmilk output by 9.5 pct over two years and reduce butter stocks,now at a record 1.2 mln tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials said new rules, which place strict limits onfarmers' rights to benefit from high subsidised prices, couldbe expected to reduce sales into intervention to a trickle andpave the way for reform in other surplus sectors.</sentence>
		<sentence>The deal was reached despite determined attempts atbacksliding by some states as the implications of the originaloutline accord reached last December began to sink in.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Despite coming under tremendous pressure, the ministersnever wavered from the main features of the deal," one seniorofficial said, adding the result augured well for talks laterthis month on other reforms.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Commission is leading the fight against food surplusesand has now proposed the most severe annual price review, atwhich ministers fix farm support prices, in the EC's history.</sentence>
		<sentence>Most prices would be cut or frozen, new quality standardsenforced, and most farmers' rights to sell to interventioncurtailed.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials say the measures could lead to effectiveprice cuts for some low quality cereals of eight to 11 pct.</sentence>

		<subject>CONGRESS EYES LOANS THAT AID U.S. COMPETITORS</subject>
		<sentence>Congressional ire is rising againstthe multinational development banks which make loans to helpother countries produce goods in direct competition withbeleagured American farmers and miners.</sentence>
		<sentence>With a record trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last yearand a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing tohold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other developmentbanks if the money is used to subsidize production or toproduce goods already in oversupply around the world.</sentence>
		<sentence>"American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreignagriculture and mineral production that is often in directcompetition with our producers," Sen. Don Nickles, an OklahomaRepublican, said in a letter to fellow senators seeking supportfor his legislation to limit these loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nickles and Sen. Steven Symms, a conservative Republicanfrom Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictlylimit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if theymake any loans to help developing countries produce surpluscommodities or minerals.</sentence>
		<sentence>Current law requires the United States to vote against suchloans but carries no reprisals if they pass anyway.</sentence>
		<sentence>Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raisedat two Senate committee hearings last week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on ForeignOperations, "as a policy matter, we oppose loans for productionof commodities in oversupply."</sentence>
		<sentence>The senators cited a 350 mln dlr World Bank loan made toArgentina last year to help it increase its agriculturalexports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans suchas a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestockexports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 atlow interest rates for agriculture.</sentence>
		<sentence>Baker said the Argentineloan was "really the only one you can point to and criticize."</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted threetimes over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Even with a favorable vote of 65 to 15, the restrictionswere weakened in the final version.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only a provision directingU.S. officials to vote disapproval was enacted into law.</sentence>
		<sentence>This year's proposal, called the Foreign AgriculturalInvestment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to voteagainst loans designed to increase production of surpluscommodities and minerals.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also, the recipient countries would have to prove that theproduction, marketing and export of the commodities could behandled without government subsidy.</sentence>
		<sentence>If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the UnitedStates would not increase or replenish funds for thatinstitution until it agrees to stop making such loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Objections to such loans have most often been raised byconservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.funding for these international development banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raisedsimilar concerns among more moderate senators.</sentence>
		<sentence>Democratic senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland told Bakerat the Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, "Many say thebanks are financing competition for American jobs."</sentence>
		<sentence>She recommended that the United States use itsparticipation in debt forgiveness for developing country loansas a wedge to open markets to U.S. goods.</sentence>
		<sentence>The administration opposes any legislation that would tieits hands in votes on the loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>It argues there might beinstances in which a country needed the money to continue itsmoves toward U.S. policies in other areas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Baker said the United States would continue to use itsleverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalizationmeasures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.</sentence>

		<sentence>Brazil has no set target forits coffee exports following this week's breakdown ofInternational Coffee Organization talks on export quotas,President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Daustersaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider itsexport plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which ithad proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken asthe country's export target to ICO-member countries.</sentence>
		<sentence>The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption anagreement would bring stability to world markets, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack ofan agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could beabove or below 15.5 mln bags, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters andmarket analysts before taking any decision on export policy,but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to marketconditions.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We will not take any short-term decisions which might causemarkets to panic," Dauster added.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffeeto sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it doesnot need an ICO agreement as a crutch," Dauster said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster saidconsumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to twomln bags in Brazil's export quotas.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial lossfor Brazil and which would be difficult for the country torecover," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year movingaverage of exportable production surpluses would lead tooverproduction as countries boosted output to win higherquotas, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibilityhad been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that itsstance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries.</sentence>
		<sentence>Close links would continue with these producers,particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone Africancountries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action wasenvisaged at present.</sentence>
		<sentence>He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to asystem of roaster buying contracts, although "no hypothesis hasbeen abandoned."</sentence>
		<sentence>Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations forMay shipment coffee will be opened.</sentence>

		<sentence>Diplomats said although other nations such as Italy,Belgium and the Netherlands were certain to oppose elements inthe system which could also substantially increase their own ECpayments, the main opposition was expected from Britain.</sentence>

		<sentence>Theopposition has also called for reforms, but they differ overhow to regain lost state revenues.</sentence>
		<sentence>One Conservative favoured possibility is abolishing taxexemption on interest from bank deposits and government bonds.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hannu Halttunen, of Helsinki bank Kansallis-Osake-Pankki(KOP), told Reuters "We want to be more free in setting interestrates and in creating different deposits to suit the individualinvestors.</sentence>
		<sentence>If tax on interest is introduced, then we prefer asystem with taxation of real interest gains."</sentence>
		<sentence>Under present laws, bank customers are exempted from tax oninterest when banks jointly set interest rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers saidthis had encouraged cartel-style banking and was hinderingtougher inter-bank competition.</sentence>
		<sentence>A London-based Nordic banking expert said liberalisationwas too strong a word to use in a Finnish context, but aConservative presence could dislodge traditional practices.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It would probably result in new practices that have beenseen elsewhere for a few years growing rather more quickly inFinland," he said, in a reference to money market instruments.</sentence>
		<sentence>All parties, especially the Conservatives, have beencareful to avoid making Finnish-Soviet trade an election issue.</sentence>
		<sentence>Moscow is Finland's largest trading partner.</sentence>
		<sentence>Until a few yearsago the Conservative Party was seen as anti-communist, but hasnow moderated its stance, political analysts say.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade between Helsinki and Moscow is based on a bartersystem, and is balanced under long-term accords.</sentence>
		<sentence>In January the two countries signed a 1987 agreement worth30 billion markka, but trade in the past two years has beendeclining due to the fall in the price of crude oil, whichaccounts for 80 pct of Finnish imports from the Soviet Union.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bankers said taxation had become the major economictheme of the campaign because there were few other issues.</sentence>
		<sentence>Inflation was 3.4 pct in 1986, compared with 5.9 pct in1985, and unemployment has increased slightly from 6.1 pct ofthe workforce in 1985 to last year's levels of 6.7 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Social democrats in 1986 doubled the country's foreigntrade surplus compared with 1985, from 2.50 billion markka to5.04 billion markka.</sentence>
		<sentence>Opinion polls say Sorsa's Social Democrats will remain thelargest party in the 200-seat Parliament, with some 26 pct ofthe vote.</sentence>
		<sentence>They currently hold 57 seats.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Centre Party, the other major coalition partner, isalso expected to hold on to its 37 seats.</sentence>
		<sentence>But increased Conservative support and a decline for theCommunists could make force Sorsa to allow the Conservativesinto government.</sentence>
		<sentence>They currently hold 44 seats.</sentence>

		<sentence>Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Controltracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that isresistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link theresulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promotethe growth of cattle.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply ofantibiotics in feed to help them grow faster.</sentence>

		<sentence>Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseasesthat develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affecthumans.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the new study, reported in Thursday's New EnglandJournal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.</sentence>

		<sentence>Leaks of a major Dutch officialeconomic forecast due to be published on Monday indicatereduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment thisyear, political and market sources say.</sentence>
		<sentence>Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitivenessthis year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wageincrease, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered somecalls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>But whatever the government's response, the central bankwill stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB)publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which willalso see a key parliamentary debate on government finances andthe economy.</sentence>
		<sentence>Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimatereflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutcheconomic growth was now seen around one pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset thedecline in export growth caused by slowing growth in WestGermany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,Pierson said in its February economic outlook.</sentence>
		<sentence>The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pctgrowth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.</sentence>
		<sentence>The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and thegovernment has already admitted it will not meet its goal ofreducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned centralbank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and ifnecessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.</sentence>
		<sentence>Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticisedthe guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark inlast January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment andexpressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economyhad become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of thedollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some analysts also question the central bank's decision notto copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and insteadlower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.</sentence>
		<sentence>Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the movesaying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact onthe money market, noting "the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at themoment not the most important Dutch rate because it is alreadyfar below the market rates."</sentence>
		<sentence>Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade ofthe Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interestrate policies serve that goal.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlandsrecently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being soldto take profits.</sentence>
		<sentence>Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark wouldreduce international confidence in the guilder and make it moredificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutchinterest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revaluedcompletely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decisionnot to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Piersonwarned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministryand the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding havingsaid before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lowerDutch rates but that the Germans should move first.</sentence>
		<sentence>One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates downto reduce the government debt burden.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates wereneeded but denied any suggestion of conflicting views betweenthe ministry and the central bank.</sentence>

		<subject>BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT</subject>
		<sentence>The Bank of England again fought againstmoney and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest ratecut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further risein its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.</sentence>
		<sentence>It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pctof its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continuedto buy into a currency which offers high relative returns andthe possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank canstop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should wantto.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wantsrates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, whenit lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct torelieve a money market shortage.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They're really making the discount houses suffer," saidStephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates."</sentence>
		<sentence>This money market signal was apparently not accompanied byany sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which hadinhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers camestrongly into the pound.</sentence>
		<sentence>The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the Londonclose, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60marks, up from 2.8720/50.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility thatrates could drop before the Budget," said Jeremy Hale, economistat finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in thebase rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to beconvinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-ratingrather than a result of short-term speculative gains.</sentence>
		<sentence>There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, saidPeter Fellner, U.K.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.    Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances ofa Conservative Party victory in any early general election, anddisappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides tohold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setbackfor bonds, Fellner said.</sentence>
		<sentence>An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but mostforecasts say it will be this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable tooil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to setthe timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.</sentence>
		<sentence>The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainablerate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at leasta proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-termcapital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.</sentence>
		<sentence>They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer betthan the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls andcurrent political upheavals in Washington.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank may want to see another few points on thetrade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But bythen sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank ofEngland," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resistingpressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sourcessaid the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as morethan just marking up by foreign exchange traders.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentiallyharmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing thatthe current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.</sentence>
		<sentence>This was above previous estimates of the current accountdeficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fellner said that under more normal conditions this wouldhave given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that theywere too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.</sentence>
		<sentence>The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearingbanks divided as well as the markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Privately, some bankofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for thisweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.</sentence>
		<sentence>If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-pointcut, with another half or full point about Budget day.</sentence>

		<sentence>Deputy Foreign Trade Minister JanuszKaczurba told Reuters that Poland would have to diverge fromtraditional Communist bloc centrally-planned economic policiesif it wanted to bring about economic renewal and compete inworld markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Stressing his commitment to a series of reforms recentlyintroduced to streamline the economy and boost export-orientedindustry, he also called for an expansion in the role of theprivate sector.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked whether the policies the government was advocatingdid not represent a departure from the strictly controlledeconomic model within the Soviet bloc, he said in an interviewwith Reuters "I don't see any alternative but to try to proceedalong the lines of economic reasoning."</sentence>
		<sentence>He referred specifically to bankruptcies, which he saidwould be "the logical outcome of a more stringent economicpolicy," once the state stopped propping up enterprises toguarantee jobs, regardless of how inefficient they were.</sentence>
		<sentence>He added, "We should follow the policy of creating a systemwhereby managers will be really responsible for the overalleconomic effect of enterprises.</sentence>
		<sentence>This can be done in one wayonly, through the reduction of subsidies."</sentence>
		<sentence>But he also noted the need to curtail bureaucracy of branchministries, allow domestic prices to reflect the world market,make foreign exchange rates more realistic, provide incentivesto export-oriented industry and encourage private business.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kaczurba was talking to Reuters about the effect on theeconomy of U.S. Sanctions imposed in 1982 in response to thesuppression of the Solidarity trade union under martial law.</sentence>
		<sentence>He acknowledged that Poland's economic decline would add toits problems in trying to regain markets and support fromWestern creditors even after Washington lifted remainingrestrictions and restored Most Favoured Nation trading statuslast month.</sentence>
		<sentence>Western officials say Polish goods have to be morecompetitive and of better quality in the face of trade wars andprotectionism amongst U.S., Japanese and European competitors.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reaffirming the government's view that the key to solvingsome of those problems and meeting payments on a 33.5 billiondlr foreign debt lay in increasing hard currency exports,Kaczura said private enterprise could play a greater role.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think we could have some 20,000 small private enterprisesactive in export-oriented business if such operators aresuccessfully convinced that the policy towards the (private)sector is stabilised," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Poland already has a more developed private sector thanmost other East European countries.</sentence>
		<sentence>Among economic reforms already under way, Kaczurba listedeasier access to hard currency profits, tax incentives, accessto investment credits and two devaluations of the zloty toincrease competitivity of prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said such policies had been welcomed by the World Bankand International Monetary Fund, through which Poland is hopingto gain new credits, but Poles were caught in a "vicious circle."</sentence>

		<sentence>Kistlersaid its counter proposal to merge with Baker InternationalCorp was still under consideration and that a merger was in thebest interests of both companies.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that isgood for both companies," Kistler said of the proposed mergerthat would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field servicecompany.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We're working very hard on this merger."</sentence>
		<sentence>Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meetingto vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concernabout a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that wouldrequire Baker to sell its drilling bit operations andsubmersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened toterminate the proposed merger.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the twocompanies first find acceptable buyers for the businessesbefore signing the decree.</sentence>
		<sentence>The directors of Baker immediately after receiving thecounter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas statecourt to force to Hughes to complete the merger.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that mightbe imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervousabout what the outcome might be," Kistler said, in explainingwhy Hughes had made the counter proposal.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We need additional time to understand why Baker did notaccept our proposal."</sentence>
		<sentence>Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker "was nota factor" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposalon the table.</sentence>
		<sentence>He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider acompromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Justice Department in January said it would block theHughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless bothcompanies agreed to sign a consent decree that would providefor the sale of the assets after the merger took place.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree becauseits was too "unreasonable."</sentence>
		<sentence>Hughes said that Baker shouldinstead complete the sale of the disputed assets before themerger is finalized and given government approval.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptablebuyers within a specified period of time after the decree isapproved, a federal trustee would become responsible forfinding a buyer.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could takeup to 10 years to complete the sales.</sentence>
		<sentence>He also expressed concern that the combined companies mightbe required by the government's conditions to license some ofits technology to any purchaser of the assets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Baker said last night in a statement that the requiredassets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,representing about three pct of the revenues of the combinedcompanies.</sentence>

		<sentence>Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the NationalMerchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talkswould lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct.</sentence>

		<sentence>Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain,Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern tothe government, which has already had to suspend interestpayments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drasticdeterioration in the country's trade balance.</sentence>
		<sentence>The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, MuriloRubens Habbema, was quoted in today's Gazeta Mercantilnewspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign shipscould be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.</sentence>

		<subject>YEUTTER SAYS BUDGET CUT KEY TO BETTER U.S. TRADE</subject>
		<sentence>A reduction of the U.S. federal budgetdeficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's hugetrade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry,Yeutter said "Capital and trade flows are clearlyinter-releated now.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get thetrade deficit down."</sentence>
		<sentence>He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages betweenthe two deficits.</sentence>
		<sentence>Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S.budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseasinvestors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesserextent, other U.S. securities as well.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlrtrade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,"Yeutter said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the problem must be approached on many fronts andfocus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetarypolicies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness andthe establishment of a "level playing field" for trade.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserveunder Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve thetrade situation by getting interest rates down.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the fiscal side, Yeutter said "the budget deficit isstill our biggest problem" and there has not been enoughprogress toward reducing that deficit.</sentence>
		<sentence>In the international area, he said that "our major tradingpartners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth."</sentence>
		<sentence>Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlrtrade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said "Japan isjust not doing the job on the import side."</sentence>
		<sentence>Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to thedollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary ofEconomic Affairs Robert Ortner.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsoredmeeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levelswas fairly priced against most European currencies, but thatthe yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The market will determine the dollar's proper value in theend," Yeutter said.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, he added that, if the U.S. andother nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S.trade deficit, "the dollar will be the equalizer."</sentence>
		<sentence>Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem andany resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislationor trade restrictions poses real dangers.</sentence>

		<subject>NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN</subject>
		<sentence>The highly visible drama involving theyen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the factthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against majorEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange ratedistortions, Japanese and European research officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statementsby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters thecurrency movements of the past two years are also creating afundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up newtrade tensions and imbalances.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade figures show that the new currency alignments arealready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.</sentence>
		<sentence>In many ways, not least in terms of rare internationalcooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact betweenthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut downthe value of the dollar was a historic one.</sentence>
		<sentence>But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the majorcurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in whichthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but notnecessarily central significance, the officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The officials said that when the Plaza agreement tookplace, the dollar was already on its way down.</sentence>
		<sentence>The agreementsimply helped it on its way.</sentence>
		<sentence>Senior EC financial expert inTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.</sentence>
		<sentence>"You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,and that was well before Plaza," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at263.15 yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was242.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention andperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, thedollar trend has been down, down, down.</sentence>
		<sentence>Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>The historical crossrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story.</sentence>
		<sentence>TheEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>The close relationship between exchange rates and tradeflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, butundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three ischanging.</sentence>
		<sentence>In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the ECboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half ofof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exportsand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have atremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unitsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is importantto them.</sentence>
		<sentence>Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that islaying the golden egg," said de Hora.</sentence>
		<sentence>The EC is worried.</sentence>
		<sentence>EC business also had a remarkable yearin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to itsstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive thanU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rateimbalance, and which will cause problems.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC isreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries.</sentence>
		<sentence>Buttherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitiveedge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First InternationalEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If you wantmy objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in ourtrade imbalance.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,and this year we may have to do so again," he said.</sentence>

		<subject>VW EXPECTS FURTHER FALL IN U.S. SALES IN 1987</subject>
		<sentence>Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> expectscurrency factors to cause a further drop in its U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sales in1987 following a 5.2 pct sales decline in the United States in1986, board member Karl-Heinz Briam said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Briam, who described the current situation of the U.S.Market as critical, also said VW was uncertain whether it wouldbe able in 1987 to fully match its record 1986 European sales.</sentence>
		<sentence>In 1986 the VW group, which includes Audi AG <NSUG.F>,delivered a record 981,000 vehicles to European markets outsideof West Germany, a rise of 5.1 pct against 1985, Briam told aregular quarterly meeting of the Wolfsburg plant's workforce.</sentence>
		<sentence>Briam said sales conditions in Europe had generally becomemore difficult in 1987 because of weaker growth rates andfiercer competition in the region.</sentence>
		<sentence>Briam gave no forecast for VW domestic sales.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he saidcar sales in West Germany for all manufacturers combined wouldprobably fall by a slight three to four pct from 1986's record2.73 mln because car sales in West Germany had likely passedtheir peak for this business cycle.</sentence>
		<sentence>Summing up his predictions, Briam said limits to growthwere becoming apparent on the VW group's most important marketsbut there were no grounds for great worries.</sentence>
		<sentence>The automobile industry, as far as VW was concerned, hadentered its fourth consecutive good year, with VW's incomingorders and sales remaining favourable overall, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Briam, who is VW's director of labour relations, also saidVW currently had no plans for further increases in itsworkforce.</sentence>
		<sentence>He told the plant's workforce that aninternationally-active company like VW must be able to adjustto changed economic conditions and manage situations in whichunfavourable currency relations restrict its room for financialmaneuver.</sentence>
		<sentence>Briam said VW needed to hold and expand market share inorder to overcome its cost disadvantages compared with some ofits foreign competitors, particularly those in the Far East.</sentence>
		<sentence>This could only be done if capital-intensive plants wereused as fully as possible, if the workers' qualifications wereraised through comprehensive training and if working hours werearranged so that expensive production plants operated asefficiently and soundly as possible.</sentence>
		<sentence>The metalworkers union IG Metall has said it plans to pushfor a 35-hour working week in its sector of West Germanyindustry this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Walter Hiller, the chairman of VW's works council, told thesame Wolfsburg meeting that a cut in the working week to 35hours was necessary to help reduce unemployment.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the works council was prepared to negotiate onmaking working hours more flexible to suit the needs of boththe company and the workforce.</sentence>
		<sentence>A seven-week strike by IG Metall in the summer of 1984 fora 35-hour week in the West German metal industry ended in acompromise that cut hours to 38.5 hours but also allowed eachcompany in the industry to decide, in consultation with theworkforce, how the reductions should be made.</sentence>

		<sentence>The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winterwheat crop.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bill would allow farmers to forego planting andstill receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.</sentence>
		<sentence>The administration has strongly urged that the bill beexpanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provisionwill emerge from the committee, the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are largeestimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimatesby the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at thistime is the major reason cited by those against an expansion ofthe bill, committee staffers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST.</sentence>
		<sentence>Aconflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, andstaffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of anexpanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas ofthe country will be underway in the next few weeks and signupfor the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.</sentence>
		<sentence>Farmers are now making their planting decisions, sosomething has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to beimplemented, an Agriculture Department source said.</sentence>
		<sentence>An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in lastweek's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommitteechairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of theconsequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings wasnecessary.</sentence>
		<sentence>Major commodity groups, including the National CornGrowers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen'sAssociation, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.</sentence>
		<sentence>But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the billcurrently is not equitable for all grains producers, so itshould be extended to other crops.</sentence>
		<sentence>There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, saidGene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.</sentence>
		<sentence>Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try todecrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in thedebate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introducea bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with theargument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any majorchanges in the farm bill.</sentence>

		<sentence>USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spreadit would be taken over.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attemptto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract asuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer orPiedmont and USAir announce a deal," speculated one arbitrager.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the currentprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid willsucceed.</sentence>
		<sentence>Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, NorfolkSouthern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for thecompany.</sentence>
		<sentence>USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half ofPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price ofPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline isdestined to be acquired by someone.</sentence>
		<sentence>USAir, they said, is theleast likely to be bought.</sentence>
		<sentence>Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation inthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of athree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn'soffer, which lacked financing and was riddled withcontingencies.</sentence>
		<sentence>Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of twoairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.</sentence>
		<sentence>"You can't discount him," said one arbitrager.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he isserious by following through with his threats or making a newoffer.</sentence>
		<sentence>In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to godirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lowerprice if USAir rejected his offer.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing," saidone arbitrager.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced byabout six dlrs per share.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airlinecombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, butothers believe it could be cleared if the companies areacquired separately.</sentence>
		<sentence>"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal towork," said one analyst.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said such a merger would be costly andcomplicated.</sentence>
		<sentence>TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahnsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.</sentence>
		<sentence>In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wagescale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, theysaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be anecessary ingredient for a merger to work.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, other analysts speculated the managements ofPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a newcompany.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a wayfor him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then mergedinto TWA.</sentence>

		<sentence>Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukmansaid the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpdceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had beendelayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opecprices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home fromJamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that inFebruary, Opec had underproduced partly because members werestrictly abiding by production quotas and partly because theywere resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to officialprices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,"he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I have spoken to every other Opec minister and theyare committed to making the accord work," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lukman gave no specific figures for February output.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hesaid the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing thesefigures.</sentence>
		<sentence>Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimatedthat Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, hesaid; "That could well be correct."</sentence>
		<sentence>Opec"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement sayinggroup output was "well below" its ceiling in February.</sentence>
		<sentence>But itgave no figures.</sentence>
		<sentence>But one source close to Opec indicated that February outputmay have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around16 mln bpd.</sentence>
		<sentence>Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had allproduced in February below their Opec quotas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Iraq, which saidit would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the Decemberpact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lukman said that some industry reports "may be correct" thatin February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mlnallocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by hiscountry were coming under price pressure because they werecurrently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades andthe United States" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, he said Opec in December had anticipated thatdemand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasonsand expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We have to be patient for two or three weeks.</sentence>
		<sentence>The market isnow firming on actual fundamentals," he said, adding that heexpected it to go "up and up" even beyond official prices afterearly April.</sentence>
		<sentence>This is when, traditionally, there is more demandfor gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria"s.    The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuelaand Indonesia were having less problems with output thanproducers like his own country because they exported oilproducts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also, some of Venezuela"s heavy grades were outside the Opecpricing system, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to liftsome Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocksand ran them down to "dangerous levels," they would eventuallyhave to buy Opec oil.</sentence>
		<sentence>"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)they will realise they should buy now instead of paying morelater on," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was beingpressured by equity producers for better terms, said it wasimportant to know that terms with them were negotiable,flexible and under constant review, not only when the marketseemed weak.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nationministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and thatsuch a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priorityfor Opec at the moment.</sentence>
		<sentence>"At this time, we have to get our priorities right," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord isworking, not dealing with a differential of cents betweengrades."</sentence>

		<sentence>Top U.S. and European farm trade andgovernment representatives called for a sweeping reform ofworld agriculture to redress a critical demand and supplyimbalance.</sentence>
		<sentence>Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets heredemonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need foran urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade andproduction.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom andharmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) thedisruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls ofprotection climb higher and the level of possible retaliationbecome more harmful," U.S. Department of Agriculture DeputyAdministrator William Bailey said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, whichends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need toadjust its policies to the changing market environment.</sentence>
		<sentence>The need for urgent reforms is justified by the "imbalanceand tensions of the world economy," the secretary general of theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and DevelopmentJean-Claude Paye said.</sentence>
		<sentence>And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, he noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>Paye stressed the need for a progressive and jointreduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measuresto help farmers in unprofitable areas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farmprices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, andinstead help farmers through income support and adjustmentaids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president ofCargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.</sentence>
		<sentence>Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must takegreater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, "differentiated policy treatment is required" totake account of large disparities in the situation around theEC, he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view ofthe total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said "30 to 40pct of the cost savings are tied up in that."</sentence>
		<sentence>"They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,"said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc."Apparently they are willing to continue discussions butwhether they will alter their position, I don't know.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's getting a little confusing," said James Carroll,analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the arguments citedby Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger "tend to be weak."</sentence>
		<sentence>Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger itwanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,the projected merger date.</sentence>
		<sentence>A government decree allowed a longerperiod of time.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hughes contended it was better to formally combine thecompanies with the status of Reed already settled.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bakerapparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.</sentence>
		<sentence>Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mlndlrs in savings if the companies were combined without sellingReed.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will besaved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was firstsigned "the outlook for the industry has improved materially."</sentence>

		<sentence>which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 cropwinter and spring wheat.</sentence>
		<sentence>This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the originalproposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987wheat only.</sentence>
		<sentence>That provision was later broadened by thesubcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but stillcollect 92 pct of deficiency payments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponeduntil next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid billand 0/92.</sentence>
		<sentence>The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot programfollows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influentialfarm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.</sentence>
		<sentence>Congressional sources said there has not been enough timeto study the implications of a broad 0/92.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The timing (of the proposal) is off," said one aide to aHouse Agriculture committee member.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, several Congressional sources said they expect abroader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the HouseAgriculture committee is faced next month with the need to makespending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as partof an overall deficit reduction package.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley(D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts mayexceed one billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both theCongressional Budget Office and the Reagan administrationestimate it would result in significant budget savings.</sentence>
		<sentence>A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5billion dlrs over five years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is theapproach of planting season, Congressional sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some officials said it already is late for implementationof a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 forwheat and feedgrains.</sentence>
		<sentence>If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up eitherwould have to be extended or reopened, sources said.</sentence>

		<subject>INTEREST IN OPTIONS STIRRED BY U.S. FARM PLANS</subject>
		<sentence>In their search for ways to cutspending on U.S. farm programs, policymakers and their advisershere are citing trading in options contracts as an alternativeto federal income and price supports.</sentence>
		<sentence>Critics of costly federal farm programs maintain that thegovernment could get out of guaranteeing minimum support pricesif farmers systematically used options contracts to protectthemselves against vacillating market prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>"With agricultural options now available, there is less needfor government price support programs to provide pricestability for farmers," the Heritage Foundation, a conservativethink tank, said in a recent position paper.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Washington no longer needs to restrict the level andvariability of commodity market prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Farmers and others inagribusiness can now achieve the benefits of price stability bytrading in option markets," the paper, written by ClemsonUniversity professor Kandice Kahl, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Critics of farm programs contend that options offer thebenefits of price support programs without entailing the costto taxpayers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kahl's paper urged farmers to buy "put" options in order toobtain the right to sell at a particular price to the privateseller of the option contract.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This gives the farmer a guaranteed price, but still allowshim to profit from higher market prices, if they are available,by foregoing his option," Kahl said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Interest in promoting understanding of options tradingamong farmers also has been stirred in Congress by a proposedchange in agricultural policy that would have the effect ofexposing participants in federal farm programs to fluctuationsin income subsidies.</sentence>
		<sentence>The proposal -- supported by the Reagan administration anda cross-section of lawmakers -- would allow farmers to receiveat least 92 pct of their income subsidies regardless of howmuch they planted.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under current law, farmers enrolled in federal pricestabilization programs receive income subsidies, or deficiencypayments, equal to the difference between a set target priceand the higher of the support price or market price.</sentence>
		<sentence>The so-called decoupling plan, or "0/92", would aim tocurtail surplus production by eliminating the requirement thatfarmers plant in order to receive deficiency payments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Critics of "0/92" plan contend that if the scheme succeededin curbing surplus output, market prices would rise anddeficiency payments fall -- leaving farmers who chose not toplant with shrunken income subsidies and no crops to sell.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), who has been in theforefront of efforts to decouple income support from acreageplantings, advocates replacing the variable deficiency paymentwith a fixed and gradually declining payment.</sentence>
		<sentence>But many farm state lawmakers are turned off by the idea ofoffering fixed subsidies to farmers who plant nothing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some congressional staff members said they are intrigued bythe notion of having the federal government subsidize thepurchase of "call" options to help farmers hedge their incomerisk.</sentence>
		<sentence>By buying a call option, the farmer would obtain the rightto buy a commodity at a particular price.</sentence>
		<sentence>If the market pricerose above that option price, the farmer could exercise theoption and sell the commodity on the spot market, making upmost of the reduction in the deficiency payment.</sentence>
		<sentence>An aide to Boschwitz said the senator might offerlegislation linking options and decoupling, but that it mighthave to await the results of a pilot project on futures andoptions trading mandated by the 1985 farm bill.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bill required USDA, in association with the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, to conduct a pilot program in atleast 40 counties which produce major program crops.</sentence>
		<sentence>The program, only recently launched, was designed toencourage producers to participate in futures and optionsmarkets and to ensure that producers' net returns would notfall below the county loan level for the crops in question.</sentence>

		<subject>BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS</subject>
		<sentence>Brazil's recent announcement of asuspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreigndebt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed viewsamong many international economists and commodities analyststhat Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>The developing world's most indebted nation is also itsmost prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such ascoffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchangerevenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"That sounds like a reasonable strategy.</sentence>
		<sentence>But there is noway they can trade their way out of this situation," AldoRoldan, Vice President for International Services at ChaseEconometrics, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle theproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on gluttedworld markets, but also had to work to make its position onforeign exchange markets more profitable.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) andexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchangerates," Roldan said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Chase economist also said commodities markets weredepressed and generally did not appear very promising for acountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he added: "They are always pretty aggressive and theyhave good foreign marketing channels."</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will becoffee, and even without background pressure from foreigncreditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit themarket this year with a vengeance.</sentence>
		<sentence>Negotiations between International Coffee Organization(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke upearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusingeach other of intransigence.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,which others wanted changed," one senior coffee dealer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted topreserve its market share.</sentence>
		<sentence>At the end of the talks, he saidBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and otherswould suffer.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario butas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, thedealer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If they do come into the market at this level it will golower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,"he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 centslower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distantdeliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.</sentence>
		<sentence>President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Daustertold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil hasno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown ofthe ICO talks on export quotas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be thefocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Theywill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,"according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc.    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plusdifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of theBrazil soybean crop.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Brazilian farmers also need cash flow andthey can't afford to store the crops," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some timeabout large South American crops developing under near idealconditions towards record yields.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier thanusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports," Loewy said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American SoybeanAssociation (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvestcould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when pricesare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to thevulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of areduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered tofarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said there has been some uncertainty this year about thesoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for pricesby keeping supplies away from the free market.</sentence>
		<sentence>Farmers canforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay theloan.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) arestarting to harvest and starting to export," Eshleman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Buthe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jose Melicias from the research department of DrexelBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as muchas it can this year because of its economic situation.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the debt situation was a major consideration.</sentence>
		<sentence>"TheBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay forstorage," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazilwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias saidit would not make a big difference.</sentence>
		<sentence>On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may bemuted no matter its need to generate capital.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, whichcould limit exports to the world market, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Thecountry may have oversold and be unable to honor exportcommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused byconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, willgive it little room to stretch exports, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year ofsurplus.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year itfell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa andfind many more markets for it," one analyst said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market wouldcollapse and they can't afford to do that," she added.</sentence>

		<sentence>But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates islikely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill LynchEconomics Inc.    "The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're allsending the same signal.</sentence>
		<sentence>This is going to raise some eyebrowsat the Fed," McCarthy said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, "Wehave some very good-looking monetary aggregate data.</sentence>
		<sentence>It'scoming in a lot weaker than I thought."</sentence>
		<sentence>The economists were quick to caution that one month's dataprove nothing, especially because money growth previously hadbeen so rapid.</sentence>
		<sentence>M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pctrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably beexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into thebooming stock market and is thus not an indication of aslowdown in the business expansion.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bondmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly areflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.</sentence>
		<sentence>McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides withsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarterprogresses.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy asthey were a month ago," he noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March andrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pctor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderateenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross nationalproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak.</sentence>
		<sentence>"You'dcertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past."</sentence>
		<sentence>There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balancesheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already underway, economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Discount window borrowings were in linewith expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.</sentence>
		<sentence>Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Incargued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much tosolve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive tradedeficit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Because of the possibility that further dollardepreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed toclose the trade gap, Brusca said "I'm not prepared to be allthat optimistic about the bond market."</sentence>

		<sentence>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funarolast night concluded this week's tour of European capitalshaving gleaned little in the way of concrete support fromgovernments for his country's attempts to find a radicalsolution to its debt payments crisis.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, banking sources noted the existence ofconsiderable sympathy for Brazil's position among most of itscommercial bank creditors, manifested in the widespread beliefthat adopting a hard line could only exacerbate the problemswhile patience might pave the way for an eventualreconciliation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil on February 20 unilaterally suspended interestpayments on its 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks,followed by moves related to around 15 billion dlrs of bank andtrade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions.</sentence>
		<sentence>The action had been preceded by a significant deteriorationin Brazil's balance of payments situation in the final quarterof 1986, along with a marked acceleration in inflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reserves had dipped to below four billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro and central bank president Francisco Gros last weekvisited Washington to explain Brazil's move to governmentofficials and agencies.</sentence>
		<sentence>This week they have sought official support in the U.K.,France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.</sentence>
		<sentence>They have now decided to extend their tour, flying onSunday to Tokyo to talk to government officials, with apossible visit to Canada before they return home.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro and Gros have so far confined their consultations togovernment representatives, believing that problems withBrazil's 109 billion dlr debt call for a political solution.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, banking sources noted that their attempts toenlist the support of European and U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Governments had beenmet almost unanimously with advice to talk first to banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>This counsel has been coupled with emphasis on the need forBrazil to present to creditors a convincing economic programme,with U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson alsorecommending an accord with the International Monetary Fund(IMF), advice which Funaro subsequently rejected flatly.</sentence>

		<sentence>Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question thathe was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward thesale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.</sentence>
		<sentence>He also declined to specify at what price the company wouldconsider selling it shares.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (ofDome Mines stock) are very attractive," Annesley commented.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a timewhen the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Aprice of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered "fairlyattractive," Annesley said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its DomeMines' shares at a premium to market prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There might be anopportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would bevirtually a control block in Dome Mines," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 onthe Toronto Stock Exchange.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructuredebt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56major creditors, which includes Dome Mines and Encor Energy.</sentence>

		<sentence>The filing comes one day after MCI Communications Corp saidthe firm will seek immediate deregulation of its principallong-distance competitor, ATT.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the approach outlined in the filing, ATT would committo continue providing basic long-distance services to allcustomers and to maintain uniform nationwide prices in allparts of the country unless granted regulatory approval to dootherwise.</sentence>
		<sentence>Specifically, ATT proposed that the FCC require the companyto file tariffs for new interstate services and price changesthat would go into effect within 14 days.</sentence>
		<sentence>In addition, the proposal calls for the reduction of thevoluminous documentation ATT is required to file each time itintroduces or changes long-distance services.</sentence>
		<sentence>The new proposal would place the burden on challengers todemonstrate that ATT's tariffs "are unreasonable".</sentence>
		<sentence>It would also require long-distance companies to submitperiodic reports to help regulators monitor competition in theindustry.</sentence>

		<subject>FEBRUARY U.S. JOBS GAINS SHOW STRONGER ECONOMY</subject>
		<sentence>Momentum in th U.S. economy may bepicking up given solid across-the board increases in theFebruary U.S. employment report, economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,twice what the financial markets expected.</sentence>
		<sentence>This follows a319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previouslyreported 448,000 increase.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Even if you look at January and February together, this isstill a much stronger report than the consensus expectation inthe market," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal muchlarger gains in February U.S. production and income thanpreviously forecast.</sentence>
		<sentence>The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from34.8 hours in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>The average manufacturing work week rose0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week sinceNovember 1966, the Commerce Department said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The gains in manufacturing employment point to a verylarge increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7pct," said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>This compares to a 0.4pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.</sentence>
		<sentence>Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Incnoted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hourin February from 8.83 dlrs in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Combined with the increase in hours worked, this meanswe'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-visthe wage and salary disbursement," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income shouldrise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the February employment gains are consistent withhis firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national productgrowth forecast of 3.7 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists agreed that the employment data were negativefor the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economyand no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>Butmost said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This report is another reason for the Fed to not considereasing," said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.    "It gives them more room to address the dollar situation," hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,but it's most likely they'll sit and wait."</sentence>
		<sentence>"The data have not been uniform," Stone added.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Durablegoods were weak in January and now employment is strong."</sentence>
		<sentence>In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S.retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gapwidened to 14.8 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Things just aren't adding up," said Steve Slifer of LehmanGoverment Securities Inc. "Consumer spending, capital spending,goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak firstquarter GNP growth of one pct," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The employment and production data point to a biginventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourthquarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth."</sentence>
		<sentence>Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain wasaccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machineryindustries returning to work.</sentence>
		<sentence>Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gainshave resulted from an improving trade outlook.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exportsgrew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase inimports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improvein the first quarter.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paperproducts, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods showthat trade is improving," Benderley said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The economy is moving between extremes," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Somereports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarterGNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct."</sentence>
		<sentence>A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greaterpart of February's employment gain.</sentence>
		<sentence>Retail services employmentrose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 inJanuary, previously reported at 166,000.</sentence>
		<sentence>Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February.</sentence>
		<sentence>Butthis follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised downfrom a previously reported 142,000 gain.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged inFebruary at 6.7 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>This means the jobless rate has stayed at6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading sinceMarch 1980, the Commerce Department noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,"Carson said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,but there's no reason to tighten.</sentence>

		<sentence>The French primary bond market is showingsigns of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargyand the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminentinterest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signalto the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, byannouncing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, whichhas stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-dayrepurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.</sentence>
		<sentence>The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate,the reference rate for interbank money market operators, whichreached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct thisweek, dealers noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank of France's "open market" policy to regulate themoney markets since December has been based on a floor andceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention andseven day repurchase rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>For the moment the sentiment is of "wait and see" on ratecuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists amongmarket operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bondmarket, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easilyabsorbed.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell asmuch paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowingneeds for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidityin the primary market at the moment despite competition fromthe surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.</sentence>
		<sentence>There has been a flood of large bond issues, but withformulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand- with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - whichhave been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipementdes Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion francbond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issuedover 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.</sentence>

		<subject>IMF URGES BELGIUM TO MAKE FURTHER SPENDING CUTS</subject>
		<sentence>The Belgian government, whichintroduced large-scale public spending reductions last year,has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there isscope for further cuts in 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusionsof the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economicpolicy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at theweekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.</sentence>
		<sentence>The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interestrate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>The team's report to the government praises last year'sspending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spendingby 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economyperform "better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far inthe 1980s."</sentence>
		<sentence>However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisationof the debt to gross national product ratio requires a muchlower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target thegovernment has set itself for 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct ofGNP in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>The report says "The most that can be afforded over the nextfew years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure ofgeneral Government."</sentence>
		<sentence>It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian taxsystem to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced taxburden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising thedebt to GNP ratio before this is possible.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expendituregrowth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions,we feel that your position would be stronger if you coulddecide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988," thereport adds.</sentence>
		<sentence>The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal thegovernment's determination to keep its currency strong and tocurb inflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>It says firmer long-term rates would slow private netlong-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt andan overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate thesubscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues inBelgian francs.</sentence>

		<subject>BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES</subject>
		<sentence>This week's Bank of England resistance tostrong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded inholding bank base rates at 11 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the ParisGroup of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterlingbroadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sourcessaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closingtrade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after theParis meeting and up 0.4 on the day.</sentence>
		<sentence>Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanteda substantial rise or fall in sterling.</sentence>
		<sentence>The question istherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.</sentence>
		<sentence>Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch EuropeLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see thetrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Even after this actionover the last few weeks, sterling's only just within strikingdistance of that range," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other analysts agree that the government probably has somebroad target range around this area.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see thepound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk ofa loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as theyare, what's to stop it (going higher)," said John Cox, executivedirector of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the Londonforeign exchange market.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been activeselling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack ofgeneral market talk of such intervention, and this has helpedkeep it below 1.60 dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Cox says the government must be worried with sterlingheading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if itholds around these levels.</sentence>
		<sentence>He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interestrate boat.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If rates don't come down, the market will say theyought to have come down and will sell sterling," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Most dealers agree there is a good deal of "hot money" beinginvested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnightor one-week rates, which could flow out at equally shortnotice.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the authorities will hope that at least aproportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) andhave to jack them back up again," said Richard Jeffrey,economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said a half point cut would ensure continued support forsterling, at least in the near term.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, most analysts are still looking for a full pointabout March 17, Budget Day.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to theBudget, said Temperton.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in therun-up to a general election, the major factor behind currentbullishness in the government bond and currency markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.</sentence>
		<sentence>He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest ratecut," said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, theequities arm of Mercury International Group.</sentence>
		<sentence>Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead theway lower were confounded today.</sentence>
		<sentence>There was excitement a fall inthe weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct lastFriday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.</sentence>
		<sentence>This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 113/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowestsince base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.</sentence>

		<sentence>Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the releaseof ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreignearnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,notably in the securities business.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock.</sentence>
		<sentence>News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's shareprice on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.</sentence>
		<sentence>Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely thefuture trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates andABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.</sentence>

		<subject>CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL</subject>
		<sentence>U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the pricecould rise another dollar as inventories fall.</sentence>
		<sentence>"OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash marketthere is tight supply of crude with short transportation timeto major refining centers," said Daniel McKinley, oil analystwith Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. "That could send prices50 cts to a dollar higher," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.</sentence>
		<sentence>The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell inFebruary more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs abarrel.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption thatoil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have comeunder question," McKinley said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthlyreport said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or inindustrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd duringthe first quarter of this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the firstquarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whoseinventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mlntonnes, or about 74 days consumption.</sentence>
		<sentence>Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpddraw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterdayfed speculation that other major companies were destocking.</sentence>
		<sentence>Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of aso-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buyingofficially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organizationto offer discounts to the official price.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This struggle between the companies and OPEC is theultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relativelysoon.</sentence>
		<sentence>I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),"the general trading manager of an international oil companytold Reuters in a telephone interview.</sentence>
		<sentence>For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cuttingexcess supplies from the market by a reduction of its ownoutput, traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output tobe 14.7 mln bpd this week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspendoil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expectingit to be there," McKinley said.</sentence>
		<sentence>International oil traders said that other short-haulcrudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asianrefiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readilyavailable Mideast crudes earlier this week.</sentence>
		<sentence>If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid upthe price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, tradingmanagers at several companies told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>But there were skeptics who said they wondered how longOPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.</sentence>
		<sentence>Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg CommodityManagement, said OPEC production was lower "because of theSaudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if itgives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas."</sentence>
		<sentence>He added, "The Saudis will be picking up the tab for othermembers who produce over their quota, and the drain on theSaudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as lowas 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in thespot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for deliveryinto the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, whichtraded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.</sentence>
		<sentence>Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the FarEast at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.</sentence>

		<sentence>The attempt by International Paper Co<IP> and Stone Container Co <STO> to raise linerboard pricescould stick, industry analysts said, citing strong demand andtight capacity.</sentence>
		<sentence>But they said rising inventories hurt the odds.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It remains to be seen whether the increases will beaccepted, but I think the odds are better than 50-50 theywill," Mark Rogers, paper analyst for Prudential Bache said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Mead Corp <ME> and Union Camp Corp <UCC> said they are alsoconsidering price increases.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rogers, who has been aggressively recommending Stone andInternational Paper for several months, said the increasescould stick because plants are running full tilt and little newcapacity is coming on stream.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The operating rates in linerboard are running at about 97to 98 pct of capacity, but demand continues to climb," GeneCartledge, chairman and chief executive officer of Union Campsaid "The industry is essentially sold out."</sentence>
		<sentence>Cartledge said domestic linerboard shipments in January hitabout 1.6 mln tons, six pct higher than January 1986, whileexports hit 170,000 tons, three to four pct higher.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nevertheless, rising inventories could nip the increase inthe bud, Lawrence Ross, forest products analyst for PaineWebber, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Containerboard inventories have been growing for the pastthree months," Ross said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Over that time inventories rose from4.8 weeks worth of supplies to 5.9 weeks most recently."</sentence>
		<sentence>Also, Ross said that the Jacksonville, Fla., paper mill, 49pct owned by Stone, is planning to come on stream again soon,which may help alleviate some of the supply constraints.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Theplant's capacity, by itself, is about two pct of the industrytotal," Ross said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But, Rogers said the Jacksonville mill "won't be enough" tosignificantly ease tight capacity this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The price increaseis necessary, he said, to attract more investment.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rates of return in the industry have been too low in recentyears to merit inventment in new capocity, Rogers said, addingthat he sees prices climbing to the 400 dlrs-a-ton range thisyear.</sentence>

		<subject>ATT <T> PHONE PROPOSAL TO HELP PROFITS</subject>
		<sentence>American Telephone and Telegraph Co'sproposal to deregulate its long distance phone service isunlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but itshould help the company's profits, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for largevolume users, but status quo for residential users," saidPaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that hasconstrained the company's profits in the long distancebusiness, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distancebusiness, the profits of which have been limited by a regulatedrate-of-return on the company's investments.</sentence>
		<sentence>The rate was cutlast year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Earlier today the company proposed to the FederalCommunications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amountof time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up toits competitors to oppose it filings.</sentence>
		<sentence>MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> made a similar filingyesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competitionin the telephone business.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs inthe long-distance unit, and increase its profit marginspreviously constrained by the rate of return.</sentence>
		<sentence>But many saidthey did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices inthe industry, simply because of the competition the phoneindustry giant faces.</sentence>
		<sentence>"You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,"said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But you wouldn'tsee a rise."</sentence>
		<sentence>Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT toselectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Itwill give ATT a lot more flexibility," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number ofcompanies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCChearings.</sentence>
		<sentence>It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, thelong distance joint venture between GTE Corp <GTE> and UnitedTelecommunications Inc <UT>.</sentence>

		<subject>CANADA'S MOVE TO SHORTEN DEBT TERMS AIDS MARKET</subject>
		<sentence>The government's move to pare its hugefinancing costs by shortening debt maturities has left moreroom for other borrowers and sparked a lively market fortreasury bills, senior market analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank of Canada, Ottawa's fiscal agent in themarketplace, revealed this week that sharply reduced borrowingneeds has allowed the shift toward shorter bond terms andheavier emphasis on the weekly treasury bill auction, issued interms of up to one year.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meantthat the government is now able to maintain lower cash balancesand lower financing costs," the Bank of Canada said in its 1986annual report released this week.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government has said its budget deficit financingrequirements will fall to 24 billion dlrs in the fiscal yearending March 31, 1987, from 30 billion dlrs the prior year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Projected fiscal 1988 requirements are 21.3 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bank said that of last year's 19 new government bondissues, nearly two-thirds were for maturities of less than 10years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Greater use was also made of bond auctions to market newissues with terms in the two- to five-year range.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, treasury bills outstanding at year end totallednearly 70 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs overthe year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although the amount of money saved from moving away fromthe long bonds was not disclosed, bond experts believe it wasconsiderable because of the much lower interest premiums paidon short term debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>But market watchers were unsure what affect the move willhave on Japanese investors--who have been snapping up Canadianbonds at a record clip--because of their traditional preferencefor long term financings.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bond traders said the Japanese, who purchased a record 9.5billion dlrs of Canadian bonds last year, have adapted to thechanges by buying longer term provincial issues and shifting tothe medium term issues offered by Ottawa.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Their (Japanese) buying over the course of the last sixmonths has been very much concentrated in the medium termmaturities," noted one Canadian bond trader who asked not to beidentified.</sentence>
		<sentence>Yet there was some concern a shortage could eventuallydevelop for bonds that mature in 10 or more years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Said David Gluskin, vice-president of Nesbitt ThomsonBongard Inc, "When interest rates finally seem to have stoppedgoing down, there is going to be a flood of people trying tolock in the long end and not everyone will be able to get inthe door."</sentence>
		<sentence>But bonds analysts said at the moment with interest ratestrending down, investors appear to welcome the change,especially the greater treasury bill financing.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The wholesale market in treasury bills is very active,"said Michael Berry, vice-president of the securities firm,Walwyn Stodgell Cohran Murray Ltd.</sentence>
		<sentence>The change also improves receptivity in the market forother borrowers, including provincial governments, the bigutilities and corporations.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There doesn't seem to any lack of bonds in the longer endnow, that also may be the result that any percieved shortagehas probably been taken up by provincial funding activities,"commented Berry.</sentence>

		<sentence>Strikes by Brazil's 40,000seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causingmajor headaches to a government already wrestling with a debtcrisis.</sentence>
		<sentence>A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25years and union leaders say they have seriously affectedBrazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.</sentence>
		<sentence>On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interestpayments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharpdeterioration in its trade balance.</sentence>
		<sentence>Today the government faced a fresh problem, when mostpetrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrialheartland, and in three other states closed down to press forhigher fuel prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>There were fears that the combination of the two stoppagescould lead to a serious fuel shortage.</sentence>
		<sentence>The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial todayentitled "Dangerous Confrontation," said: "From the economicpoint of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost,with grave consequences for the supply situation and for thecountry's external trade."</sentence>
		<sentence>The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejectedoffers of up to 100 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is dueto rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal.</sentence>
		<sentence>But a seniorofficial of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis LeaoFranco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardlessof the tribunal's ruling.</sentence>
		<sentence>Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapseover the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan pricefreeze.</sentence>

		<subject>DOME PETE<DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR</subject>
		<sentence>Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressurefrom one of its largest creditors, <Canadian Imperial Bank ofCommerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,energy industry analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security forpart of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock topay down debt, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in thedirection that might make it a saleable asset," said one analystwho asked not to be named.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome earlier said it was not considering selling EncorEnergy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest inCanadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd <DM> is up for sale "atthe right price."</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment thatit does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said.</sentence>
		<sentence>TheEncor shares do not pay dividends.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when askedwhether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.</sentence>
		<sentence>At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would bevalued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Minesshares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may alsoprompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in theCanadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially inrecent weeks with a runup in crude prices," Peters and Co Ltdoil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see itsold at these levels because they can get more for it now thanthey have been able to in recent years," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around sixdlrs in early February.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company also recently set up its own operatingmanagement, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome and Encor "are actually going to get farther apart.</sentence>
		<sentence>So(the sale) does make a lot of sense," Mote said.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divestEncor in favor of retaining the operating assets since saleproceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt toCommerce Bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long asthey can," said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move toblock such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Other creditors generally all want to make sure thatsomething they might be able to get a piece of is not beingsold out from under them," said analyst Gobert.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr jointliability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by ArcticPetroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder thepossible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum'sdebt and has a "right of consent" to the sale of Dome Petroleum'sholding.</sentence>
		<sentence>Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shareswould seek some type of relief on the company's debtobligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at whatprice the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share "are veryattractive."</sentence>

		<sentence>Advocates of a 0/92 plan forfeedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if adisaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee isscaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressionalsources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English(D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals toimplement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.</sentence>
		<sentence>An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even thatscaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains shouldbe treated equally, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, thensupporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably notoffer their proposals next week, sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. CharlesStenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, butwhether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.</sentence>
		<sentence>Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's firstchoice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheatfarmers.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, if the political reality is that disaster aidfor winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because ofcontroversy over spring wheat, then English might consider aneven greater cutback in the bill, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and stillreceive 92 pct of deficiency payments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)</sentence>
		<sentence>have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill toinclude a 0/92 program for feedgrains.</sentence>
		<sentence>An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farmbill, but to be fair to all crops.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers wouldlikely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant aregreater than to idle the land, economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it ispremature to make major changes in the farm bill and that theHouse Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely theimpacts of such a program.</sentence>

		<subject>BRAZIL CRISIS SPURS RETHINK OF DEBT STRATEGY</subject>
		<sentence>Brazil's economic crisis is forcing awholesale re-examination of the established strategy fordealing with developing-country debt, leading bankers say.</sentence>
		<sentence>While finance minister Dilson Funaro is unlikely to succeedin his attempt at seeking an outright political solution to thedebt problem, Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68billion dlrs of commercial bank debt has convinced at leastsome bankers that new ideas are needed.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The time has come to look at the alternatives," oneseasoned debt rescheduler said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Even before Brazil's move, the difficulty in syndicatingthe 77 billion dlr financing package for Mexico agreed to inprinciple last October was prompting top bankers to examine the way they are managing the debt crisis.</sentence>
		<sentence>Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, too, spoke recentlyof "debt fatigue" and the need to breathe new life into debtrescheduling procedures.</sentence>
		<sentence>There are already signs of change.</sentence>
		<sentence>Japanese banks aresetting up a jointly owned firm to which they will transfersome LDC loans in a bid to strengthen their balance sheets,improve financial management and get tax breaks.</sentence>
		<sentence>But bankers said a move toward a greater governmental rolewill be gradual.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The process is such that you cannot expecttangible progress in a short period of time," one banker said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Certainly, Funaro got a frosty reception in Washington andseveral European capitals in the past week when he called ongovernment officials to explain Brazil's crusade for apolitical dialogue on debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford, forinstance, criticized what he called large-scale solutions suchas debt forgiveness or the creation of new multilateral lendingagencies.</sentence>
		<sentence>"While such approaches may have some political appeal, theyare impractical and ultimately counterproductive," Mulford tolda House subcommittee this week.</sentence>
		<sentence>He could have added that anyproposal that might be construed as a bail-out of U.S. bankswould be a non-starter in Congress.</sentence>
		<sentence>But bankers said the Reagan Administration could promoteaccounting and regulatory changes to foster debt-equity swapsand debt securitization and to enable banks to considerinterest capitalization as an alternative to new loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Experts say the government must also make it easier forbanks gradually to write down their third-world loan books.</sentence>
		<sentence>Mulford, in his Congressional testsimony, urged the banksto explore different options.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The banks should be encouragedto look at the so-called menu approach," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers said the aim would be to keep the loan syndicatesintact or, conversely, to allow small banks to write off theirexposure in a way that is not detrimental to major lenders.</sentence>
		<sentence>Big banks say it is unfair that small creditors continue toreceive interest on old debt even if they do not contribute tonew loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>In effect, large banks say they are making new loansthat fund the interest payments on the old debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>To solve this problem - and to streamline the cumbersomenegotiating process - Argentina has revived the idea of "exitbonds", which would be issued at a discount to small creditorsin exchange for their existing debt, bankers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bankswould be rid of the loans but would have to recognize a loss.</sentence>
		<sentence>Amid the swirl of new ideas, even the role of thecommercial bank advisory committees has come under scrutiny.</sentence>
		<sentence>The principle of consensus on which the panels operate waschallenged recently when Citibank - ironically, the originalarchitect of the committee system - stubbornly refused for atime to endorse financing offers to the Philippines and Chile.</sentence>
		<sentence>The strains have not gone unnoticed in Washington.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Theredoes seem to be a lot of speculation about the frailty of thebank advisory committees," a U.S. official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil's Funaro heavily criticized the panels in London onMonday, charging that they are unresponsive to new ideas andthat U.S. banks are over-represented on them.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hannes Androsch, chairman of Austria'sCreditanstalt-Bankverein, said there was some truth to thecharge.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Sentiment is growing in Europe that we're no longerprepared to bail out the U.S. banks," he told reporters in NewYork this week.</sentence>
		<sentence>While U.S. bankers obviously see things differently, somehave started to wonder whether the advisory committee is stillthe right tool for the job.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The debt crisis has probably evolved beyond the capacityof commercial banks alone, at least in some cases," one top NewYork rescheduler said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But, with governments unable or unwilling to play a largerrole, bankers see no alternative to the advisory committee.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's the worst form of government there is apart from allthe others," one banker said, paraphrasing former British primeminister Winston Churchill's opinion about democracy.</sentence>

		<subject>POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES</subject>
		<sentence>Higher oil prices and stronger thanexpected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S.interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positivechart outlook, financial analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employmentduring February was above market expectations for a rise of170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bondfutures that drove the June contract through key technicalsupport at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,"said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner.</sentence>
		<sentence>The 101-2/32 levelin the June bond contract had been the top of a three-monthtrading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesdayled to bullish forecasts by chartists.</sentence>
		<sentence>But analysts called it a false breakout on the weeklycharts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32may signal a bearish double top formation portending steeplosses.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I tend to go along with the double top scenario," saidNorthern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the factthat the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures hasoccurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.</sentence>
		<sentence>Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leinerremains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should findsupport between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.</sentence>
		<sentence>The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectationthat the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based onan improving inflation outlook.</sentence>
		<sentence>With the dollar stable and economic data giving the FederalReserve little room to ease monetary policy, "the inflationoutlook is improving," Leiner said, and that should lead torelatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollarprices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil pricesremains a concern for the inflation outlook.</sentence>
		<sentence>Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations weremaintaining production quotas and official prices, and got anextra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports fromEcuador after an earthquake Thursday.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,"said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.</sentence>
		<sentence>The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely"media induced," Singer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He noted that even though OPECproduction may be within quotas, "oil stocks are attremendously high levels."</sentence>
		<sentence>Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oilprices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, hesaid, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.</sentence>

		<sentence>Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian SocialUnion Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference alsoattended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union andFree Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billionmark reduction would represent net tax relief.</sentence>

		<sentence>The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cutsalready planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.</sentence>

		<sentence>Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West Germanyard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safetystandards.</sentence>

		<sentence>The suspension of Ecuador's crude oilshipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last atleast four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official said Ecuador could resume exports afterrepairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which linksjungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.</sentence>
		<sentence>It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.</sentence>
		<sentence>The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the12-point international Mercalli scale.</sentence>
		<sentence>The damage to thepipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oilaccounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as60 pct of government revenues.</sentence>
		<sentence>Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisationof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumpingabout 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpdabove the output quota assigned by the cartel, another EnergyMinistry spokesman said.</sentence>

		<sentence>He estimated it could takeabout 60 days to build.</sentence>

		<subject>GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS</subject>
		<sentence>Increased federal government borrowingneeds and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buymark assets could push yields in German public authority bondshigher this year, bond market sources say.</sentence>
		<sentence>"At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-termrates.</sentence>
		<sentence>But how rates move in the long end will depend stronglyon foreigners," one portfolio manager for a large securitiesinvestment house in Frankfurt said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources also said the government had already stepped upits borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, thesources noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of sixpct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.</sentence>
		<sentence>This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pctcoupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>But dealers said the terms were not enough to attractforeign investors, and the federal government would have topush yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sources noted federal government issues had also increasedin size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volumeonly starting last May.</sentence>
		<sentence>One finance ministry economist said "It isn't more.</sentence>
		<sentence>It'sjust the size (of each bond) which has increased."</sentence>
		<sentence>He addedconditions in the capital market currently remained fairlyfavourable for raising new debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.</sentence>
		<sentence>With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, ashopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sources said the government has may have already stepped upits borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowingthrough bonds was 26.6 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said this indicated a move by the governmentout of other types of debt to gain access to foreign fundsthrough the more acceptable loan stock form.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a largeamount of issues maturing recently, other factors, includingthe government's tax reduction program, would also reduceincome next year.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The problem here will be the tax reform," theportfolio manager said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He added that the government's cut in its top income taxrate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult forthe government to reduce borrowings.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said the government would fall far short ofcovering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from thetax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced tofall back on debt markets in one form or the other.</sentence>
		<sentence>The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federalgovernment loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallenback twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through theissue of fixed-rate medium-term "Kassenobligation" notes.</sentence>
		<sentence>A finance ministry economist said the government did notexpect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only anet 22.3 billion marks this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend wouldprobably not continue next year as the further tax cuts comeinto effect.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform wouldmean government borrowing will increase," the manager said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, withthe Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculationfalling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.</sentence>
		<sentence>But sources said foreign demand for the new federalgovernment loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that thedollar may now rise against the mark.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The demand wasn't so good," a dealer for a German bank inLondon said.</sentence>

		<sentence>The outlook for Australian industrialinvestment is uncertain, with capital spending at an historicallow and business overly dependent on domestic demand, theAustralian Chamber of Manufactures and the National Instituteof Economic and Industry Research said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The organizations were commenting in their monthly EconomicFocus on a survey commissioned by the Australian Council ofTrade Unions concluded.</sentence>
		<sentence>Private investment as a proportion of gross domesticproduct fell to 9.8 pct in 1985/86 from 15 pct in 1981 and isforecast to decline to 8.8 pct in 1987/88, the Focus said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Earlier studies indicated private investment could sustaina two pct long-term economic growth rate, but the latestfigures suggested this could not be maintained, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Australian dollar's depreciation, coupled with researchincentives, is increasing the profitability of investment forexports but several factors inhibit growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>These include weakcommodity prices, high fixed capital costs, uncertain domesticeconomic policy and corporate debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Firms have tended to finance expansion with debt ratherthan equity, leading to a 39 pct rise in the ratio of interestpayments to gross cash flow between 1980/85, the survey found.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economic Focus said many companies looked for a 2.5 to 4.5year payback on capital investment or export development --often too short a period to secure markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>The relatively low incentive to produce for export in partreflected the ownership of Australian industry, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sixty-seven pct of Australian-owned companies said externaldemand was conducive to investment against only 27 pct forforeign-owned companies.</sentence>
		<sentence>The survey covered 45 companies accounting for about 25 pctof total investment, Economic Focus said.</sentence>

		<subject>JAPAN RATING AGENCIES IN BATTLE WITH U.S. GIANTS</subject>
		<sentence>Three Japanese credit rating agencies areentering into fierce competition with <Moody's Japan K.K.> and<Standard and Poor's Asia Inc>, the local branches of the twoU.S. Giants, as the Japanese credit market opens up toforeigners, Japanese rating agency managers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Standard and Poor's recent triple-A rating of <Chiyoda Fireand Marine Insurance Co Ltd's> claims-paying ability caused theJapanese agencies, which had rated Chiyoda's convertible bondonly A-plus, to come under some criticism for being tooconservative, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Chiyoda is Japan's eighth largest non-life insurer.</sentence>
		<sentence>Standard and Poor's Corp has been in the business for morethan a century while <Moody's Investors Service Inc> wasfounded more than 80 years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence>Each has rated some 20,000 to30,000 U.S. And about 100 Japanese issues.</sentence>
		<sentence>With Japanese insurers eager to issue more bonds throughoverseas financing companies, Chiyoda's rating will stimulatetheir interest in using the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Agencies, the analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Standard and Poor's said Chiyoda's rating was based on itsstrong capitalisation, stable performance and high levels ofunrealised appreciation, particularly in its stock portfolio.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S. Agency also emphasised the favourable regulatoryenvironment in which Japan's non-life insurers operate.</sentence>
		<sentence>Japanese agencies were shocked by the earlier AAA ratingson the claims-paying ability of <Sumitomo Life Insurance Co>and <Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co> by Standard and Poor's,the first ratings given to Japanese life insurers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Strong Japanese insurers can accumulate cash to ward offshocks from any foreign investment, Standard and Poor's said.</sentence>
		<sentence>A month ago <Nippon Investors Service Inc> (NIS) assignedan AAA rating to <Financial Securities Assurance Inc>, a U.S.Firm that gives financial guarantees on corporate securities.</sentence>
		<sentence>"NIS has assigned rates on a U.S. Firm for the first time inJapan, which was the first step into the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rating market,"Kazuya Kumura, general manager of NIS, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kyosuke Yoshida, managing director of Japan Bond ResearchInstitute (JBRI), said, "Agencies should be more actively usedto respond better to growing overseas investor interest."</sentence>
		<sentence>Takeshi Watanabe, president of Japan Credit Rating AgencyLtd (JCRA), said, "(Our) advantages are that we have a deeperunderstanding of business practices in Japan, other Asiannations and Japanese investor behaviour and are also more alertand quick to react to domestic news."</sentence>
		<sentence>JBRI, with 12 years' experience, is Japan's largest agency.</sentence>
		<sentence>The other two have been in business for two years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Finance Ministry approval of yen commercial paper issues byJapanese residents, which is expected soon, will stimulatelocal agencies to grow quickly, securities analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Finance Ministry is encouraging more use of agencies bygradually abolishing limits on corporate debt creation.</sentence>
		<sentence>In December it allowed non-residents holding at least anA-rating from one of the agencies to issue samurai, shogun andeuroyen bonds without first meeting the normal stringentfinancial criteria.</sentence>
		<sentence>But local companies, regardless of the rating obtained fora planned bond, must meet the tough financial criteria set bycommissioned banks and underwriters, which includes minimum netasset requirements and capitalisation, local agency managerssaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Commissioned banks are responsible for protectingbondholders and conducting principal and coupon payments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Investors' risk in corporate default has been checked bythe very system that is slowing the smooth growth of Japanesecredit rating agencies, the managers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The idea of rating in Japan has been woven intoprerequisites for an issuer company to satisfy financialcriteria," JCRA's Watanabe said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Finance Ministry, commissioned banks and securitieshouses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling forcompanies wanting to issue non-collateral straight bonds.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. SEEKS MAJOR JAPANESE ECONOMIC CHANGE IN APRIL</subject>
		<sentence>The United States has openly attackedJapan's tight-fisted fiscal policy for the first time andwarned Tokyo its promised economic package in April must besignificant, senior U.S. Officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In high-level talks last week, the U.S. Criticised Japan'soverall fiscal policy as deflationary and argued that itsfiscal position is not as dire as it says.</sentence>
		<sentence>The criticism reflects a growing feeling among some U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Policy-makers that Japan's tight fiscal policy is frustratingattempts to stimulate domestic demand and boost imports.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Attack represents a distinct shift by theconservative Reagan administration, which until recently hasbeen sympathetic to Tokyo's efforts to reduce the governmentrole in the economy, diplomats said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pointing out that Japan pledged in Paris last month to takeaction to boost demand, a senior U.S. Treasury official saidthe April package must be more than routine.</sentence>
		<sentence>Japanese government bureaucrats have already said they donot expect the package to contain much more than a rehash oflast April's measures.</sentence>
		<sentence>That means accelerated public investment, lower interestrates on government housing loans and measures to pass alongthe benefits of the strong yen to consumers, none of whichwould have a major immediate economic impact.</sentence>
		<sentence>Several Japanese officials agreed that the real obstacle tostimulating the economy is the fiscal policy pursued by theFinance Ministry and said they welcomed the shift in U.S.Policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>But they expressed concern that the move might backfire byfanning resentment against U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Interference in domesticaffairs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Makoto Kuroda, vice minister for international affairs atthe Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said Japanwould stimulate the economy not in response to U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Criticism,but to meet mounting pressure from Japanese businessmen.</sentence>
		<sentence>The shift in U.S. Policy is also causing some nervousnesswithin the Reagan administration.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs AllenWallis told reporters last week the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Does not necessarilywant an increase in Japan's budget deficit.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There are many measures Japan could take to stimulate itseconomy," he said.</sentence>
