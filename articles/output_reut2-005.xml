		<subject>BRAZIL DEBT POSES THORNY ISSUE FOR U.S. BANKS</subject>
		<sentence>CitiCorp <CCI> appears to be diggingin its heels for tough negotiations over the billions ofdollars in loans that Brazil owes to money center banks, WallStreet analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I view it as pre-negotiation posturing," said analystCarole Berger of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc, referring to bothBrazil and Citicorp.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil recently stopped paying interest onits commercial bank debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Today, CitiCorp said its firstquarter income would be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after tax if itlists the loans as non-performing status.</sentence>
		<sentence>Citicorp filed an 8-K form with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, indicating a material change in its financialsituation.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Citicorp is saying you can't scare us with threats,we'll make your loans non-performing right now," Berger said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The loans have to be treated as non-performing after 90days without a payment.</sentence>
		<sentence>CitiCorp said only that the situationwill be reviewed at the end of the current quarter.</sentence>
		<sentence>Berger asserted that Brazil is doing its own politicking bytalking to U.S. regulators and trying to drive a wedge betweenU.S. and European banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Merrill Lynch and Co said it isunlikely the situation will be resolved until the second halfof this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Ultimately the Brazilians are going to have to pay up onall the interest they owe," Cohn said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The real issue is therescheduling of debt terms.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another question is whether or not the InternationalMonetary Fund can help Brazil with a new austerity program.</sentence>
		<sentence>Stocks of money center banks were mostly down fractions inlate dealings.</sentence>
		<sentence>One trader most stocks in the group bounced offtheir lows by midday as investors took the news in stride.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cohn said the bank stocks may be risky until numbers onnon-performing loans are reported for each bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he saidinvestors looking ahead six to 12 months might want to buy atpresent levels for the "tremendous fundamental values" in thegroup.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analyst Robert Gordon of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc saidManufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC) has the greatest exposure toBrazilian loans of any New York bank, in terms of percentage ofearnings.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said his only two recommendations currently amongNew York banks are J.P. Morgan and Co <JPM> and Bankers TrustCo <BT> which happen to have the least exposure.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gordon said his positive opinion on J.P. Morgan and BankersTrust was not merely a response to the fact that the two havelower exposure to Brazilian loans than other banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>In fact he said there's a chance those banks could get moreinvolved in the future.</sentence>
		<sentence>He noted that Morgan has already set upa brokerage subsidiary to deal in loans to less developedcountries.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't see any reason to change full year earningsestimates, said Frederick Meinke, analyst at E.F. Hutton Co.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hethinks the confrontation with Brazil could end in a replay of asituation that occurred with Argentina in 1984 and 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meinke noted that in the case of Argentina the loans becamenon-accruing for a couple of quarters but then when the bankscame to an agreement with Argentina all the back interest waspaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>"What it did was distort the quarterly earnings pattern,"he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said in the case of Brazil write-offs of loans is aworst-case outcome which is highly unlikely.</sentence>
		<sentence>He noted thatBrazil is a country with a diversified economy, going throughsome economic upheaval after the transition from a military toa civilian government.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The countries of Latin America have too much debt relativeto their ability to service it," said John Mason ofInterstate Securities.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We've been fiddling around with theseproblems for five years and the hour is growing late."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said up to now the banks have reduced their spreads, cutinterest rates internally and extended maturities and none ofthese measures has been enough.</sentence>
		<sentence>He expects re-classification ofas much as a third of the loans as non-accruing and he seespartial write downs of some loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nevertheless Mason thinks the money center bank stocks could be poised for a short term rally.</sentence>
		<sentence>A spokesman at First Chicago Corp <FNB> said it ispremature to put Brazil's loans on a cash basis.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It is ourexpectation that economic development will allow Brazil to meetits debt," a spokesman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers Trust in New York said it would be premature tomake a decision.</sentence>
		<sentence>Several other banks queried by Reuters saidmuch the same thing.</sentence>
		<sentence>A spokesman at Manufacturers Hanover noted that of 2.3billion dlrs in loan exposure to Brazil only 1.3 billion issubject to Brazil's unilateral moratorium on repayment ofinterest.</sentence>

		<subject>AFTER G-6, ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS</subject>
		<sentence>Central banks have easily beaten backthe foreign exchange market's first test of the industrializednations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar,sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher.</sentence>
		<sentence>Butoperators got their fingers burned as one by one the centralbanks signalled their displeasure.</sentence>
		<sentence>"So far G-6 has been a roaring success,"said James O'Neill,financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The central banks are sending strong signals that theywon't tolerate any kind of momentum building behindcurrencies," added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>On February 22, the finance ministers and central bankgovernors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K.-- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord underwhich they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability ofexchange rates around prevailing levels.</sentence>
		<sentence>The agreement was viewed by many in the market as anattempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeabletwo-year decline against major world currencies.</sentence>
		<sentence>And initially, traders indicated their respect for theaccord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower.</sentence>
		<sentence>But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday beforethe G-6 accord.</sentence>
		<sentence>The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economypicked up steam in February at the same time as the West Germaneconomy was regressing.</sentence>
		<sentence>But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gavetraders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed theidea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bankactually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simplytelephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about tradingconditions.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the dollar quickly backed off.</sentence>
		<sentence>It hovered today around1.85 marks.</sentence>

		<sentence>Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of Englandintervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K.currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before theG-6 pact.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies likethe Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor aftertraders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuantto the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit playson dollar/mark and dollar/yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improvingU.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for theincumbent Conservative party in any general election.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There was a real run on sterling," said Anne Mills ofShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870dlrs last night.</sentence>
		<sentence>It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterdayand from a peak of about 2.98 recently.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There's been someheavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday'sU.K. budget," said James McGroarty of Discount Corp.    As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. andBritish central banks, they acclerated their shift intoCanadian and Australian dollars.</sentence>
		<sentence>But here too they werestymied.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollartoday, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday.</sentence>
		<sentence>And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent,sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. centstoday from a high of 69.02 Thursday.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle suddenupward movement, leave the market uncertain about its nextstep.</sentence>
		<sentence>Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to avery tight range against the dollar for several months.</sentence>
		<sentence>The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound longsterling/short mark positions established lately.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Because of the change in perceptions about the health ofthe German economy, the funds from those unwinding operationsare ending up in yen," a dealer at one U.K. bank said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders,lower industrial output and slowing employment gains.</sentence>
		<sentence>Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities whohave invested heavily overseas, for example in Australianfinancial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of theend of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.</sentence>
		<sentence>Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the mostcontroversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit withJapan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test ofthe dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency.</sentence>
		<sentence>In its latest review of the foreign exchange market throughthe end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that itintervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28.</sentence>
		<sentence>On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level inJanuary.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the market has to bear in mind that time marcheson and the situation changes," said McGroarty of Discount.</sentence>

		<sentence>U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the ConservationReserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutralto bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdownwould be needed to assess the full price impact.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted incorn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what thetrade was looking for," Dale Gustafson of Drexel BurnhamLambert said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres intothe conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837acres.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate ofplanted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, butsome other analysts said they would adjust their estimatesslightly.</sentence>
		<sentence>The USDA is due to release planting intentionsfigures March 31.</sentence>
		<sentence>Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation programrecently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreageto 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.</sentence>
		<sentence>Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities,said there was not enough information to completely assess theconservation figures.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainlydisappointing," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of theenrollment figures.</sentence>
		<sentence>Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative forboth new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean anupward adjustment in planting intention figures.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificatesonto the market this spring, he said: "The trade was definitelylooking higher, so certificates are going to be less thanexpected."</sentence>
		<sentence>The USDA offered a special corn "bonus" rental payment tothe farmers to be paid in generic certificates.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bonusamounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm programpayment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into thereserve.</sentence>
		<sentence>Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, saidthe conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she hadexpected, although she noted that some trade expectations wereconsiderably higher than the actual figures.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think it is friendly for the market, at least in thelong run," she said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was someconfusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figurebetween 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up orthe latest addition.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bidinto the program," she said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideasabout corn planting figures as a result of the conservationsign-up.</sentence>
		<sentence>She added that while some trade guesses were as low as61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in thehigh 60's.</sentence>

		<sentence>"All of the movement occurs at the opening,"afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said.</sentence>

		<subject>MEXICO TEMPORARILY HALTS DEBT-EQUITY SWAPS</subject>
		<sentence>Mexico has temporarily suspended itsdebt-equity swap program in a move that some bankers see as anattempt to increase pressure on reluctant foreign banks toparticipate in a new 7.7 billion dlr loan for the country.</sentence>
		<sentence>The scheme, which gives foreign firms access to cheap pesosto finance investment in Mexico, is likely to resume soon afterthe loan package is signed on March 20.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the move is a further indication of the strains thathave developed between Mexico and the banks because of thedifficulty of syndicating the huge loan, bankers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers said that Mexico suspended the swap program onFebruary 25.</sentence>
		<sentence>Adolfo Hegewisch, Mexico's Undersecretary for Commerce,confirmed that the swap program had been halted, but he told aEuromoney conference on debt-equity swaps that Mexico had beenforced to act because it had been inundated with applications.</sentence>
		<sentence>Between January 1 and February 15, 132 firms had applied todo a debt-equity conversion, compared with 100 between May andDecember 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We were not accustomed to receive so muchwork," said Hegewisch, who is responsible for foreigninvestment in Mexico.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers said applications totalling two billion dlrs hadpiled up at the finance ministry, which has said it wants tolimit the amount of swaps to 100 mln dlrs a month.</sentence>
		<sentence>But some bankers, who declined to be identified, said thehalt also suited Mexico as it would keep up pressure on thebanks during the final campaign to persuade all 400 creditorsworldwide to participate in the loan.</sentence>
		<sentence>Over 97 pct of the loan has been subscribed, but dozens ofsmaller banks are still baulking.</sentence>
		<sentence>Assistant U.S. TreasurySecretary David Mulford said yesterday that the reluctance ofthese banks had nearly jeopardized the deal at one stage.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Mexicans basically said, We're not going to subsidizeforeigners until we have a deal," one banker said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other bankers, however, said Mexico's motives were not sosinister and that the suspension was mainly due to the absenceof top ministry officials in New York for the debt talks.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They want to focus on the deal, and they wanted the banksto focus on the deal," one source said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Apart from the present disruption, bankers and companyofficials said the Mexican debt-equity scheme has been a hugesuccess.</sentence>
		<sentence>Frank Fountain, Assistant Treasurer at Chrysler Corp, saida 100 mln dlr swap it made in December had gone so smoothlythat Chrysler has plans for more.</sentence>
		<sentence>Chrysler, working through Manufacturters Hanover Trust Co,bought Mexican public-sector debt with a face value of 110 mlndlrs, mainly from European banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>The cost was about 65 mlndlrs in cash and paper.</sentence>
		<sentence>It then presented the paper to Mexico's central bank andreceived the equivalent of 100 mln dlrs worth of pesos which itinvested in its local subsidiary to produce cars for export toNorth America.</sentence>
		<sentence>Susan Segal, senior vice president of ManufacturersHanover, said the swaps not only reduce Mexico's debt burdenbut help to recapitalize local industries that may have beensqueezed out of the local capital markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fountain said that even a large well-established firm suchas Chrysler had found it difficult to arrange long-term pesofinancing on reasonable terms in Mexico.</sentence>
		<sentence>Industrial companies have done most of the swaps to date,and Hegewisch said that many of the applications now pendingare for investments in the electronic and chemical industries,with Japanese and Korean firms showing particular interest.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the interest is spreading.</sentence>
		<sentence>Segal said ManufacturersHanover has been authorized to convert part of its ownportfolio of loans into equity investment in Mexican hotels.</sentence>
		<sentence>She said the sums involved are considerable, but gave nodetails.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bank is also looking into joint ventures withmanufacturing and trading companies, Segal added.</sentence>
		<sentence>And, as part of the agreement with the banks that will besigned next week, Mexican residents will be allowed toparticipate in the scheme, hitherto reserved for foreign firms,in the hope that some of the 30 billion dlrs estimated to beheld abroad will be repatriated.</sentence>

		<sentence>Negotiators at a United Nationsconference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement(INRA) have agreed on basic elements in a new pact, conferencechairman Manaspas Xuto said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We have resolved major differences of opinion," he toldReuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>Xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord,to replace the current one which expires in October.</sentence>
		<sentence>Xuto said: "I welcome the friendly and cooperativeatmosphere that has prevailed without interruption" since thetalks began last Monday.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try toratify the new agreement," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The renegotiation conference, under the auspices of theU.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is thefourth such meeting in two years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on fourpoints:    1) Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months.</sentence>
		<sentence>Previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervalsbetween price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact.</sentence>
		<sentence>2) If the average of the daily market indicator prices oversix months prior to a review is below (or above) the lowerintervention price (or the upper intervention price), thereference price will be automatically revised downwards (orupwards) by five pct unless the International Natural RubberOrganisation council decides on a higher percentage.</sentence>
		<sentence>If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes,the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pctunless the council decides on a higher percentage.</sentence>
		<sentence>3) If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price atwhich the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes isbrought into operation will be two Malaysian/Singapore centsabove the floor price -- or 152 cents.</sentence>
		<sentence>4) The floor price will not be breached.</sentence>
		<sentence>Throughout thetalks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal tolower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock,currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.</sentence>

		<sentence>The head of a Philippine panel chargedwith recovering illegal wealth accumulated by former PresidentFerdinand Marcos and his associates said they still controlledlarge funds circulating in the country's economy.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on GoodGovernment (PCGG) told Reuters in an interview: "There is everyreason to believe that the cronies and President Marcos and hisfamily were able to hide millions and millions of pesos beforethey fled.</sentence>
		<sentence>As a matter of fact we have been able to get hold ofcrates of newly printed currency."</sentence>
		<sentence>Diaz did not give figures, but said: "We believe they stillhave a lot of funds.</sentence>
		<sentence>These are the funds that they will use inthe coming elections.</sentence>
		<sentence>These are the funds that they used tostage those coups."</sentence>
		<sentence>He was referring to congressional elections scheduled forMay 11 and to the three coup attempts faced by PresidentCorazon Aquino since she toppled Marcos a year ago.</sentence>
		<sentence>Diaz said the PCGG so far has recovered cash and propertyvalued at about eight billion pesos and had sequestered sharesof stock of at least 286 firms.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We have achieved more than whatwe thought we could achieve in one year," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The PCGG, set up by Aquino in February 1986, has sweepingpowers of sequestration, seizure and inspection of bankaccounts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Diaz said the panel's main task is to gather evidencefor legal prosecution.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But we have to sequester before we filea case and that is the legal objection because they say that weshoot first before we ask questions," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said dividends from seized shares were held in trustfunds pending court verdicts, adding several Marcos associateshad made confessions about their wealth.</sentence>
		<sentence>He did not name them.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They are very concerned and afraid that if their namesappear something may happen to them," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government last week announced that businessman AntonioFloirendo, an associate of Marcos known as the "banana king," hadturned over 70 mln pesos in cash to the PCGG and promised tosurrender titles to property in New York and Hawaii worthanother 180 mln pesos.</sentence>
		<sentence>In return, the PCGG said it had liftedfreeze and sequestration orders on Floirendo's properties.</sentence>
		<sentence>Diaz said there were already similar preliminary agreementswith another Marcos associate, Roberto Benedicto.</sentence>
		<sentence>He saidBenedicto had surrendered control of several newspapers andradio and television stations and agreed to PCGG control of theboards of a bank and a hotel he owned in the Philippines.</sentence>
		<sentence>Diaz said the PCGG based its estimates of illegal wealth onincome-tax returns and land titles of Marcos associates.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Anything over and above reported income -- that's what we haveto recover," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said a decision by the PCGG last week to probe streetcertificates held by brokers at Manila's two stock exchangeswas prompted by suspicion that illegal funds were incirculation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Street certificates describe securities held in the name ofa broker or another nominee instead of a customer so as topermit easy trading or transfer.</sentence>

		<sentence>There was a slight recovery the followingday.</sentence>
		<sentence>The presidents of the two exchanges appealed to Diaz tocarry out the probe discreetly so investors were not scaredaway, saying street certificates did not necessarily indicate"anomalous transactions."</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's unfortunate that (news of the probe) leaked out to thepapers," Diaz said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Diaz said PCGG suspicions were aroused by the stock marketboom over the past year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Manila Stock Exchange compositeindex jumped 224 pct from 131.32 to 424.81 in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>"One of our functions is to see to it that these assets thatwe have sequestered do not go right back into the hands of the(Marcos) cronies," he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television newsagency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around threemln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPECquota.</sentence>
		<sentence>Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, willcontinue to restrain production as long as other OPEC membersadhere to the pact, Nazer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its productionceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed pricesaveraging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.</sentence>

		<sentence>Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and allmembers were abiding by its agreements.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We've heard news every now and then of violations but theywere not at all verified," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.</sentence>
		<sentence>Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February buthave firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels astraders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.</sentence>
		<sentence>"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program asdevised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere tothe agreement," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from theNeutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floatingstorage, Nazer said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom hadreturned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC.</sentence>
		<sentence>Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mlnbpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand andover-production by some OPEC states.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is being playedby OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by othermembers of OPEC," Nazer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during thirdquarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then theOPEC members will consult with each other and take thenecessary measures."</sentence>

		<sentence>EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on theEC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax ondomestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off aproposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.</sentence>
		<sentence>The proposal was the most controversial part of a reformpackage, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later thismonth, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen asthe root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and oftensions with major trading partners.</sentence>
		<sentence>The proposal is described by its promoters as astabilisation program which would penalise a new sector goinginto massive overproduction and complement proposals to cutcereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forwardtax.</sentence>
		<sentence>They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fatsproduction and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left bya fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some twobillion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farmcosts.</sentence>
		<sentence>It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers aswell as foreign exporters, led by the United States.</sentence>
		<sentence>The diplomats said the protests had been received from mostcorners of the developing and developed world, ranging fromSenegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada,Iceland and Norway.</sentence>
		<sentence>The proposal had little chance of approval by ECgovernments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it asBritain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal alsounconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.</sentence>
		<sentence>Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France andGreece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did notseem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added tothe list of products affected.</sentence>

		<sentence>Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AXsports model, he said: "All the budgetary forecasts that we havebeen able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvementin 1987, compared with 1986," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA <PEUP.PA> group,increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct infirst two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier.</sentence>

		<sentence>The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of theEuropean market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from2.9 pct in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet thedemand," Calvet said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cutthe deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to moderniseits range and improve productivity.</sentence>
		<sentence>Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.</sentence>
		<sentence>This weekend he said that those profit estimates "remainabout the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic."</sentence>
		<sentence>Some of this optimism is due to the early success of theAX, launched on the French market last October.</sentence>

		<sentence>Leading industrial nations will meetagain next month to review their accord on currency stability,but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for nowthe countries will live up to commitments to speed up economicgrowth.</sentence>
		<sentence>The narrow currency movements of recent weeks stronglysuggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed thenormally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seemlikely to build on that stability.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreementlast month was the main reason markets were calm.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he said in an interview that financial markets alsounderstood, "That all six countries concluded that the measuresto be taken over a period of time in the future should fosterstability of exchange rates around current levels.</sentence>
		<sentence>That is infact what has happened since Paris."</sentence>
		<sentence>Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part bythe decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet andcease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.</sentence>
		<sentence>Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, butleft room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official refused to comment, however, on whether theagreement included a secret pact to consider furthercoordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nationshave taken jointly several times in the past year.</sentence>
		<sentence>On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies werewithin ranges broadly reflecting underlying economicconditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budgetdeficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>The shake-up would strengthen the U.S.</sentence>

		<sentence>"I think these changes will strengthen the President's handpolitically and the stronger he is politically the better offwe are with the Congress and the better off we are ininternational fora," said the official, an Administrationeconomic policymaker.</sentence>
		<sentence>"So it would be beneficial to thecontinued conduct of our initiatives."</sentence>
		<sentence>But the official also said the Administration would resistcalls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a targetEuropeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened tostop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached1.86 to the dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>British authorities are also understood tohave intervened to curb sterling's strength.</sentence>
		<sentence>International monetary sources say finance ministers andcentral bankers, who will review market performance and theirown economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washingtonjust before the April 9 policymaking meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Parispact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April toshow that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recentlywhen Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl toldbankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates ifthe Fed was ready to follow suit.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Reagan Administration official said this would show therehad been some change in approach on the part of the centralbank in Germany.</sentence>

		<sentence>These dollar-denominated notes would be sold by banks at adiscount to multi-national firms which would then convert themat face value with the central bank, thus receiving subsidizedpesos for use in funding government-approved investments.</sentence>

		<sentence>The Philippines would conserve foreignexchange and enjoy investment inflows, reducing marginally theneed to seek new bank loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the banks rejected the PINs proposal in its originalform, fearing regulatory and accounting problems.</sentence>
		<sentence>They were also reluctant to veer from the principle thatinterest should be paid in cash not paper, fearing that otherdebtor nations would emulate the idea, bankers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ongpin sweetened his original offer by guaranteeing thathis government would redeem the notes at 7/8 pct over LIBOR ifthere was no buyer in the secondary market.</sentence>

		<subject>VW CURRENCY LOSSES SEEN INVOLVING SEVERAL TRADERS</subject>
		<sentence>The extraordinary foreign exchangeloss of 480 mln marks reported last week by Volkswagen AG<VOWG.F> (VW) is so large that outside currency traders wereprobably involved in the case, currency sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>They were commenting after weekend newspaper reports thatprosecutors were transferring the focus of their enquiries toFrankfurt, West Germany's main foreign exchange centre.</sentence>
		<sentence>Volkswagen announced last Tuesday that it had called inprosecutors to investigate a possible fraud involving currencyhedging.</sentence>
		<sentence>The newspaper Welt am Sonntag said the investigation bystate prosecutors was now considering whether the alleged VWcurrency manipulators had outside banking accomplices.</sentence>
		<sentence>The transactions were only possible, "because the culpritspossessed genuine bank forms, with the help of which they wereable to deceive controllers for years," the newspaper said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But currency sources said there were so many loopholes inevery bank's currency dealing system that controls could easilybe avoided.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rolf Selowsky, financial member of the management board,has resigned in the wake of the affair, a VW spokesman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Selowksy's resignation followed a VW announcement on Fridaythat foreign exchange chief Burkhard Junger had been dismissedand Guenther Borchert, head of the financial transferdepartment, had been suspended along with Siegfried Mueller,head of the central cash and currency clearing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Four other members of the foreign exchange staff were alsosuspended, but no charges have been laid.</sentence>
		<sentence>VW Supervisory board chairman Karl Gustaf Ratjen saidentire data tapes had been erased and programs altered inforged transactions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Der Spiegel magazine said VW financial controllersdiscovered the uncovered positions on February 18 when VWexpected a currency forward contract with the HungarianNational Bank to mature, but Hungarian bank officials said theyknew nothing of the transaction and the supposed contracts wereforgeries.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Budapest-based bank refused to buy the dollars and hasnot commented on the affair.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Hungarian National Bank is, along with the Soviet Bankof Foreign Trade, one of two major East Bloc currency tradersand most major banks based in Germany deal with it regularly.</sentence>
		<sentence>It would not be possible, the sources said, for any bank torenege on a genuine forward contract since this wouldimmediately become known and effectively prevent the bank fromoperating further in the spot or forward currency markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Longer-maturity forward contracts, even contracts of up to10 years, were now becoming more common, they said but thelonger and larger the contract, the more likely it was that itwould be transacted with a domestic institution.</sentence>
		<sentence>Being one of Germany's most diversified multi-nationals, VWhas exposure in a large number of currencies and dealt in thesewith most banks in Frankfurt and also abroad, sometimes throughcurrency brokers, although it has the reputation of doingrelatively little hedging, currency sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They (VW) are always in the market, more or less trading asa bank," one senior dealer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some newspaper reports said the losses were incurredbecause of VW's failure to take out currency hedging contractsbeginning at the end of 1984, when the dollar was rising.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the currency sources said market speculation was thatdollar income of around one billion dlrs was involved and thatthe bulk of the transactions occurred last year since whichtime around 50 pfennigs per dollar was lost when the dollarfall continued.</sentence>
		<sentence>Longer-maturity currency contracts for more than 100 or 200mln dlrs each were rare.</sentence>

		<subject>GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS</subject>
		<sentence>German banking authorities areweighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in anattempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticatedcapital market instruments, banking sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options areunder closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they mayresemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. ToJapan.</sentence>
		<sentence>Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division ofbanking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-Britishproposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate.</sentence>
		<sentence>But banking sources said West Germany was more likely toproduce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latterstages," one representative of the German Banking Association inCologne said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers expect rule changes this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, WestGermany's four major banking associations and the FederalBanking Supervisory Office.</sentence>
		<sentence>Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changeswould require a revision of Germany's credit law, which hasbeen in effect since 1934.</sentence>
		<sentence>Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fitpresent circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentarypolitical process of changing it, banking sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limitedbanks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves,on a consolidated basis.</sentence>
		<sentence>But lending ratios do not extend to several newerinstruments such as spot and forward currency contracts,currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs,currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currenciesand various innovative types of interest rate hedges.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposalslay in differentiating between different types of risk factor,and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swapsthan interest swaps.</sentence>
		<sentence>But even if German banking authoritiesagree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree onhow to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series offormulae for assessing the stream of payments involved inswaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financialintermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.</sentence>
		<sentence>This is the so-called market-to-market value.</sentence>
		<sentence>But German authorities are likely to consider this much toocomplex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule oflending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness ofthe borrowers involved, the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extendedto include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for publicauthorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreignbanks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.</sentence>
		<sentence>A further complication is that the more flexibledefinitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May putGerman banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version ofthe U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.And British authorities, the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-datedforeign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, bebrought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despitethe fact that the risk may be entirely different.</sentence>
		<sentence>How new regulations will affect foreign banks here wasuncertain.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many have converted to full subsidiary status andapplied for a full banking licence over the last two years inorder to lead-manage mark eurobonds.</sentence>
		<sentence>But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lendingratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement,particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if theyare required to include more transactions in the balance sheet,the sources added.</sentence>

		<subject>EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED</subject>
		<sentence>European sugar beet plantings areexpected to show little change from last year, despite recentfirmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while,so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lowerareas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade analysts said their private reports give similarresults and do not differ significantly from the first estimateof stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by WestGerman sugar statistician F. O. Licht.</sentence>
		<sentence>Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agriculturalexperts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improvedseed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this.</sentence>
		<sentence>In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a lateboost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointingstarts to growing seasons.</sentence>
		<sentence>Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producerswill grow so-called "C" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the worldmarket.</sentence>
		<sentence>This is what is produced in excess of the basic areaneeded to meet the EC "A" and "B" quotas, which receive full andpartial price support, respectively.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some analysts said the open row that broke out last weekbetween producers and the EC commission over its export policycould have serious implications for future sugar output.</sentence>
		<sentence>Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearlyone mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks asthey feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate forthe gap between high EC internal and low world market prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point,this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resistinghigher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a futurecut in the basic "A" and "B" quotas, they added.</sentence>
		<sentence>In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quotasugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said firstplanting intentions indicate an area about the same as lastyear's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The basic trend is towards stability," a FIRS spokesmansaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, whitesugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are notencouraging higher planting levels, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Beet sugar outputlast year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlandsbut below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11.</sentence>
		<sentence>In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans,since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industrysources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The farm ministry said a December survey is stillvalid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmedby just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average.</sentence>
		<sentence>Licht last week estimated West German plantings at areduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signedup U.K.</sentence>
		<sentence>Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet.</sentence>
		<sentence>This shouldyield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year's cropequalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>British Sugar has "A" and "B" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnesof whites and its "C" output is due to improved yields from moreconsistent disease-resistant seed types.</sentence>
		<sentence>Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, WincentyNowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated SugarIndustry Enterprises, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>World prices are still below Polishproduction costs and there is no way to convince farmers toincrease the area above the already signed contracted level.</sentence>
		<sentence>The national plan, set before prices began to rise, putplantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in1986, Nowicki said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>World prices have less impact in Italy than in France orGermany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared tothe domestic market, an official at the national beet growers'association said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Italian sowings are not yet complete butsurveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especiallyin the north where some farmers have switched to soya.</sentence>
		<sentence>Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higherthan expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from arecord 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comesinto force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largestDutch sugar processor, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnesof white sugar and to cut output of "C" sugar.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year, theNetherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugaragainst a combined "A" and "B" quota of only 872,000 tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The world price of sugar would have to rise much higherthan it has done recently to make planned production of "C" sugarreally worthwhile," the spokesman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet plantingintentions are likely to be unchanged.</sentence>
		<sentence>Licht put this year'sSoviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, butdiplomats said policy is to balance supply with domesticdemand.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings areestimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De DanskeSukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchangedfrom 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha.</sentence>
		<sentence>In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domesticdemand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 haagainst 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugarcompany Svenska Sockerfabriks AB.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due tolate sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, downfrom 37,600 in 1986.</sentence>

		<sentence>While world exchanges revel in acontinuing securities boom, the Dutch stockmarket remainslacklustre despite a series of largely positive annualcorporate results and signs of a more stable dollar, analystssaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Prices and turnover on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange havesprung back from lows reached when the dollar dipped below thetwo guilder mark in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>But market analysts say only lowerinterest rates or a further rise in the dollar, now trading ataround 2.09 guilders, could keep the momentum going.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Between end-1982 and end-1986 Dutch stocks rose by around150 pct, but the dollar's sharp fall last year put the brake onthe bull market," said Philip Menco, analyst with bank CLN Oyensen van Eeghen.</sentence>
		<sentence>The dollar's current level compares with an average in 1986of 2.45 guilders, and 3.35 in 1985, official figures show.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Arjen Los, analyst with Dutch merchant bank Pierson,Heldring en Pierson, sees room for some optimism,   "The market is exaggerating the whole dollar affair.</sentence>
		<sentence>We'veseen the bottom of its decline.</sentence>
		<sentence>But what is lacking is astimulus on the interest rate front," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said they expected little impact from provincialelections on Wednesday as the government's position was secure.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The scope for price rises in Dutch shares is narrow, giventhe limited room for lower interest rates," said Los, adding theDutch market can currently only dream of returns of around 15pct seen in rising markets elsewhere in Europe.</sentence>
		<sentence>"When the dollar slumped in the second half of 1986, U.S.And U.K investors were heavy sellers of Dutch stock.</sentence>
		<sentence>They madean enormous currency gain," Menco said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Finance Ministry figures show foreign investment in Dutchstock last year fell by nearly half to 4.2 billion guilders.</sentence>
		<sentence>Los envisaged no significant revival of foreign interest inthe Dutch market.</sentence>
		<sentence>He saw the large, liquid Dutch pension fundspursuing a more aggressive portfolio management policy whilecontinuing to invest in markets with weaker currencies.</sentence>
		<sentence>Outflows of non-bank Dutch capital totalled a record 21.4billion guilders last year, 12.3 billion of which stemmed fromsecurities transactions.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Dutch institutions have been rallying to buoyant foreignmarkets, but this season's results could coax some of them backto the relatively underpriced Dutch market," Koos Ten Have ofStaal Bankiers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ten Have said Dutch price/earnings ratios based onforecasts of 1987 results were broadly unchanged compared with1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>With an average ratio of 10, they were still attractivelylower than shares of other exchanges, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the reliability of the strong guilder was a furtherfactor favouring Dutch stock investments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Senior bank economists said this week's official economicforecast by the CPB planning agency painted a gloomy picture ofthe Dutch economy but this would not shake investor confidencein the Dutch business sector.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Dutch economy was doingrelatively well compared with other nations, they added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts say most companies have fulfilled expectations,while some firms, particularly in food and publishing,surprised the market with continued solid profit growth despitemajor dollar and sterling investments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Unexpectedly positive results from companies like UnileverPlc-NV <UN.AS>, NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS> andHeineken NV <HEIN.AS> were balanced by poor performances by thethree banks, which achieved higher profits partly by reducingtheir risk provisions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts still have doubts about theinsurance sector, and many companies stressed the negativeimpact of lower currencies on their guilder earnings in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>Food and publishing are seen as major growth areas, despitethe fact many of these companies have significant activities inthe U.K and U.S.    Food chain Ahold NV <AHLN.AS> reported an 8.1 pct increasein net 1986 profit but said it did not see profits growing in1987 due to the uncertainty of the dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>Turnover declined by 5.7 pct to 11.4 billion guilders.</sentence>
		<sentence>About 1.5 billion guilders of this decline was due to the lowerdollar and one third of turnover volume was achieved in theU.S.    "Ahold is too cautious over the dollar," Los said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"As long assuch companies continue to maintain their U.S. Activities andfund their expansion there, the negative influence is purely anaccounting effect."</sentence>
		<sentence>Koninklijke Wessanen NV <WESS.AS> and Heineken also managedhandsome profit increases of 16.6 and 7.5 pct respectively,while blaming disappointing turnover in their substantialoverseas activities on the lower dollar.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SWISS OPTIONS AND FUTURES</subject>
		<sentence>Preparations for the launch of a Swissoptions and futures exchange, billed as the first completelyelectronic market of its kind, are at an advanced stage,according to members of the project team.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex)is a new departure in that it will introduce an additionalrange of financial instruments and electronic trading methodsto the traditionally conservative Swiss market.</sentence>
		<sentence>There will be no physical exchange floor and both tradingand clearing systems will be completely automated.</sentence>
		<sentence>The new market, due to start operating in January 1988,follows a series of innovations by the bourses in Zurich, Basleand Geneva aimed at preventing loss of business in the face ofkeen competition from London and Frankfurt.</sentence>
		<sentence>These innovations included the introduction last October ofcontinuous trading in major shares, plans to establish a singlecontinuously updated Swiss share index from next month tosupplement the various indices produced by the major banks atthe close of business, and experiments in electronic trading.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banks themselves last year took the initiative of launchingcovered warrants on the shares of other Swiss companies.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If Switzerland wants to maintain and expand itsinternational prominence in portfolio management, our bankersand fund managers must have the same modern instruments attheir disposal as their competitors," says Soffex presidentRudolf Mueller, a director of Union Bank of Switzerland.</sentence>
		<sentence>The computer terminals on which business will be conductedwill be confined to Switzerland.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is still unclear how manySwiss-based institutions will seek membership of the exchange.</sentence>
		<sentence>Formal applications are not due until next month but apreliminary survey completed by the Soffex project team thisweek showed strong interest in membership.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The response from both Swiss and foreign institutions allover the country has been very encouraging," says PhilippeBollag of the project team.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hans Kaufmann, who follows Swiss equities for Bank JuliusBaer, says a regulated traded options exchange should boostforeign interest in Swiss shares and possibly increase bourseturnover generally.</sentence>
		<sentence>The possibility of protecting portfolios by hedging shouldattract Swiss institutional investors, Kaufmann added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Soffex is a private company set up by the five major Swissbanks and the bourses of Zurich, Geneva and Basle.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trading will initially be limited to stock options on 10 to15 leading Swiss bearer shares.</sentence>
		<sentence>An options contract on the newSwiss share index should follow within six months but tradingin financial futures will be delayed until an unspecifiedfuture date.</sentence>
		<sentence>Options on foreign shares may also be added later.</sentence>
		<sentence>Participants will be either brokers or dealers, operatingin the market through computer terminals in their own offices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trading must be conducted exclusively through the exchange.</sentence>
		<sentence>Exchange membership is open to banks, traders and brokeragefirms with an office in Switzerland, while Clearing Membersmust be recognised as banks under Swiss law.</sentence>
		<sentence>The trading system, based on Digital Equipment Corpsoftware and hardware, provides for the display of best bid andoffer prices, matches orders electronically, allows anonymousnegotiation of block orders and maintains members' order books.</sentence>
		<sentence>An "interest" facility, aimed at helping participants togauge the market mood, shows the number of users watching aparticular instrument at any time.</sentence>
		<sentence>Most of the electronicclearing functions will be carried out overnight.</sentence>
		<sentence>Each contract will cover only five shares instead of the100 shares normally traded on existing options and futuresmarkets in the United States, London, Amsterdam and Stockholm.</sentence>
		<sentence>This reflects the fact that Swiss shares often costthousands of francs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bearer shares in F. Hoffman-La Roche undCo AG <HOFZ.Z>, likely to be on the Soffex opening list, werequoted this week at 209,000 francs each.</sentence>
		<sentence>Contracts will initally be offered for the three end-monthsfollowing the trading date plus the subsequent January, April,July or October end-months.</sentence>
		<sentence>Longer maturities may be added infuture if market liquidity permits.</sentence>
		<sentence>Detailed provisions have still to be worked out in areassuch as margin requirements, position limits, the supervisoryand regulatory functions of the exchange and brokerage fees.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banks polled by Reuters in a random survey wereenthusiastic about Soffex but reticent about the level of theirown involvement and about the exchange's prospects for success.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We're moving into completely new surroundings and it willrequire a change in psychology," said a securities dealer at amajor Swiss bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We in Switzerland are not used to sitting allday at a screen where nobody shouts at you."</sentence>
		<sentence>Moving into traded options will also require considerableinvestment in equipment and staff by participants.</sentence>
		<sentence>Completelynew dealing and back-office skills will have to be acquired andsome banks are already sending staff abroad for training.</sentence>

		<subject>COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS</subject>
		<sentence>The credibility of government efforts tostabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to thetest over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how abuffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, governmentdelegates and trade experts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped whenInternational Coffee Organization members failed to agree onhow coffee export quotas should be calculated.</sentence>
		<sentence>This week, manyof the same experts gather in the same building here to try toagree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.</sentence>
		<sentence>The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding theInternational Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock lossesrunning into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also castinga shadow over commodity negotiations.</sentence>
		<sentence>The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability tocompromise as governments do not want to be involved in pactswith built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clearlines drawn between aid and trade.</sentence>
		<sentence>A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basicelements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement inGeneva at the weekend.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some importing countries insist the International CocoaOrganization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied withquota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa tobe bought.</sentence>
		<sentence>One consumer country delegate said this would"distort, not support" the market.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCOfor destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffeeprices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts canfounder.</sentence>
		<sentence>On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoafutures down to eight month lows.</sentence>
		<sentence>The strength of sterling hasalso contributed to the recent slip in prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the"must buy" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,which came into force at the last ICCO session in January butwithout rules for the operation of the buffer stock.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumers and producers could not agree on how it shouldoperate and what discretion it should be given.</sentence>
		<sentence>The agreementlimits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says itcannot operate on futures markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying orselling operations, were carried forward from the previousagreement.</sentence>
		<sentence>Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy onall cocoa they trade.</sentence>
		<sentence>It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group onbuffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will beover non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock shouldpay when trading different types of cocoa.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another workinggroup is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrativematters, and the full council meets on Thursday.</sentence>
		<sentence>Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock fundsshould not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-membercountries such as Malaysia.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the bufferstock should buy it rather than compete with chocolatemanufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.</sentence>
		<sentence>The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linkedto the one over differentials for different qualities.</sentence>
		<sentence>European industry and trade advisers have suggested as acompromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that canrepresent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futuresmarket's existing differentials for different qualities.</sentence>
		<sentence>Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par ontothe London market.</sentence>
		<sentence>Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse wouldoperate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell thehighest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.</sentence>
		<sentence>The January talks were slowed by a split inside theEuropean Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with Francesiding with producers.</sentence>
		<sentence>EC representatives met in closed sessionin Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common groundand, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positionsamong the 12 nations.</sentence>
		<sentence>The source said the EC will be looking for signs offlexibility on the part of producers in the next few days andwill be able to respond if they are there.</sentence>
		<sentence>One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer splitsaid consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less andbacks the concept of the pact which is "meant to support themarket where trade buying is not."</sentence>
		<sentence>In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell theircocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other, more technical, issues still outstanding includewhether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced"posted price" as in the previous pact or by announcing it isbuying then accepting offers.</sentence>
		<sentence>In either case, delegates said, it is accepted thatproducers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers ofcocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in away that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.</sentence>

		<sentence>Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February buthave firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels astraders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.</sentence>
		<sentence>"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program asdevised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere tothe agreement," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from theNeutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floatingstorage, Nazer said.</sentence>

		<sentence>"Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainlydesires price stability," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom hadreturned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC.</sentence>
		<sentence>Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mlnbpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand andover-production by some OPEC states.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is being playedby OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by othermembers of OPEC," Nazer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during thirdquarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then theOPEC members will consult with each other and take thenecessary measures."</sentence>

		<sentence>Britain and West Germany told theirEuropean Community partners they would strongly oppose majorelements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.</sentence>

		<sentence>West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, willadvise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenanceother proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said West Germany's objections were put in a letterthis weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, thepresident of the EC's Executive Commission which had putforward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new ECcash crisis.</sentence>

		<sentence>Leading industrial nations will meetagain next month to review their accord on currency stability,but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for nowthe countries will live up to commitments to speed up economicgrowth.</sentence>
		<sentence>The narrow currency movements of recent weeks stronglysuggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed thenormally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seemlikely to build on that stability.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreementlast month was the main reason markets were calm.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he said in an interview that financial markets alsounderstood, "That all six countries concluded that the measuresto be taken over a period of time in the future should fosterstability of exchange rates around current levels.</sentence>
		<sentence>That is infact what has happened since Paris."</sentence>
		<sentence>Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part bythe decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet andcease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.</sentence>
		<sentence>Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, butleft room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official refused to comment, however, on whether theagreement included a secret pact to consider furthercoordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nationshave taken jointly several times in the past year.</sentence>
		<sentence>On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies werewithin ranges broadly reflecting underlying economicconditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budgetdeficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>The shake-up would strengthen the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Position in futureinternational talks.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think these changes will strengthen the President's handpolitically and the stronger he is politically the better offwe are with the Congress and the better off we are ininternational fora," said the official, an Administrationeconomic policymaker.</sentence>
		<sentence>"So it would be beneficial to thecontinued conduct of our initiatives."</sentence>
		<sentence>But the official also said the Administration would resistcalls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a targetEuropeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.</sentence>
		<sentence>Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specificagreement to defend those bands with intervention.</sentence>
		<sentence>According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>There is no official confirmation that specific bands  wereset, although the agreement used the term "ranges", for the firsttime in an international economic agreement.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely tofoster currency stability around current levels.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened tostop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached1.86 to the dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>British authorities are also understood tohave intervened to curb sterling's strength.</sentence>
		<sentence>International monetary sources say finance ministers andcentral bankers, who will review market performance and theirown economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washingtonjust before the April 9 policymaking meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Parispact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April toshow that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recentlywhen Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl toldbankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates ifthe Fed was ready to follow suit.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Reagan Administration official said this would show therehad been some change in approach on the part of the centralbank in Germany.</sentence>

		<subject>TALKING POINT/EASTERN AIRLINES <TEX></subject>
		<sentence>A rash of firings, fears of mass layoffsand management overtures for wage concessions have set thestage for all-out war between Eastern Airlines and its unions,analysts and labor leaders say.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bitter labor-management dispute has hurt efforts torevive the ailing carrier and could ultimately lead Texas Air,Eastern's new owner, to tranfer scores of Eastern jets to itsnon-union sister airlines, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's a trump card that Texas Air could resort to if thingsget bad enough -- repainting Eastern planes and shifting themover Continental Airlines," said Louis Marckesano, an analystfor Janney Montgomery Scott Inc of Philadelphia.</sentence>
		<sentence>Eastern lost 130.8 mln dlrs in 1986, and analysts seelittle chance of the carrier returning to profitability thisyear.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since the Miami-based carrier was taken over by Texas Airlast year, the morale of Eastern's 38,000 employees hasplummeted, workers and labor leaders say.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some Eastern officials acknowledge privately that moraleproblems have contributed to high absenteeism and a decline incustomer service, triggering a barrage of passenger complaints.</sentence>
		<sentence>Union leaders are accusing Eastern's managers -- many ofthem newly installed by Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo -- ofconducting a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed atridding the airline of high-paid, senior employees.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's an underhanded way of forcing experienced people outin an attempt to cut the company's labor costs," said NancyTauss, vice president of the Transport Workers Union Local 553.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some flight attendants complain that they are being stalkedby what they call "spyriders" -- teams of auditors they sayhave been hired by Lorenzo to fly on Eastern jets and secretlyexamine flight crew performance.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since the beginning of the year, at least a dozen flightattendants have been fired as a result of such audits, some forhaving as little as two dlrs missing from liquor sales andmovie headset rentals, Tauss said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Eastern officials acknowledge that management is tighteningits accounting procedures and cracking down on absenteeism,which the airline says cost 70 mln dlrs last year -- the highest in the industry.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Eastern spokeman Jim Ashlock denied that the Miami-baseairline was using unfair labor tactics.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We're just trying tocorrect long-standing problems and that causes somedissatisfaction," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, has met withgroups of dissident Eastern employees in Atlanta and isreported to have told them he may call for hearings on theairline's labor tactics.</sentence>
		<sentence>Labor and management have a long history of bitterrelations at Eastern Airlines.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the conflict has escalated sharply since January 21,when Eastern president Philip Bakes called for a reduction of490 mln dlrs, or 29 pct, in annual labor costs, mostly throughunion concessions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Eastern's three principal unions have rejected demands forwage cuts and have refused to open their contracts forrenegotiation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Union officials say that in retaliation for theirresistance, the airline has launched a "firing frenzy" aimed atintimidating employees and squeezing concessions from labor.</sentence>
		<sentence>During 1986 -- the year in which Texas Air managers assumedcontrol of Eastern -- 123 flight attendants were fired.</sentence>
		<sentence>Thatwas nearly five times greater than 1985, the union said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In thefirst two months of this year 35 flight attendants losing theirjobs, according to union records.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other unions report similar losses.</sentence>
		<sentence>Texas Air last month said it would switch six of Eastern'swide-body jets to Continental, its cut-rate sister airline.</sentence>
		<sentence>Eastern has begun hiring other Texas Air carriers to repairits planes in several cities and plans to shut down somemaintenance bases, according to a recent internal memo.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Texas Air is not going to write checks to Eastern tounderwrite an outmoded labor cost structure," Bakes told ameeting of Miami businessmen this month.</sentence>

		<subject>TECHNOLOGY/DESKTOP PUBLISHING</subject>
		<sentence>This month's endorsement byInternational Business Machines Corp <IBM> of two desktoppublishing software products should add some much-neededstandards to one of the fastest growing segments of thecomputer industry, analysts say.</sentence>
		<sentence>Desktop publishing is a relatively new market but industryanalysts estimate that sales will reach one billion dlrs thisyear and jump to six billion dlrs by 1990, fueled by the rushof corporations to bring their printing and publishing needsin-house rather than to more expensive outside printers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Printing is a big expense for most companies.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analystsestimate U.S. corporations will spend about six to 20 pct oftheir total operating budgets on publishing expenses this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>At a desktop publishing conference in Chicago earlier thismonth, IBM said it will adopt Adobe Systems Inc's Postscripttypesetting language in future electronic printing products.</sentence>
		<sentence>IBM also said it will support Microsoft Corp's Windowsoperating environment as the graphics interface standard infuture publishing announcements rather than its own Topviewenvironment.</sentence>
		<sentence>"IBM's announcement will give tremendous stimulation to thedevelopment of the desktop publishing market," said DavidGoodstein, president of the consulting firm Interconsult Inc.    "It gives users permission to go ahead and buy products thatare already available without being afraid that they will notbe compatible with whatever IBM does," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The advent of personal computers, laser printers andgraphics software has allowed users to design and printbrochures, newsletters and a host of other communications attheir desks for a fraction of the cost of an outside printingfirm.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts credit Apple Computer with creating desktoppublishing when it introduced its Macintosh personal computerfour years ago, with its easy-to-use formats and excellentgraphics capabilities.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since then Digital Equipment Corp, Xerox Corp, ApolloComputer Inc and a number of other vendors have identifieddesktop publishing as a major growth area.</sentence>
		<sentence>IBM entered themarket only last July when it formed its Publishing SystemsBusiness Unit.</sentence>
		<sentence>IBM's embrace of the already-widely usedPostscript, a language that interprets computer commands andtranslates them into instructions for the printer, was anacknowledgment of what is already a de facto standard.</sentence>
		<sentence>Both users and makers of electronic publishing systems saidthe support of the world's largest computer maker was criticalto the language's ultimate acceptance by users.</sentence>
		<sentence>John Warnock, president of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Adobe,said, "Ten pct of corporations have (moved) into desktoppublishing but 90 pct are still sitting back and waiting for anIBM announcement."</sentence>

		<sentence>Debt securities issued by major U.S.banks are under pressure in the secondary market as investorsshy away from the paper because of Brazil's suspension ofinterest payments last month, analysts and traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>On February 20, Brazil said it would suspend interestpayments on 68 billion dlrs owed to foreign commercial banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>No date was established for the renewal of payments.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Buyers have backed away from bank paper.</sentence>
		<sentence>These securitieshave become very difficult to sell despite a rise in theiryields," said one corporate bond trader.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Debt issues of major money center banks will probablycontinue to trade off until such time as the Brazil situationis resolved," said Loretta Neuhaus, a vice president withMerrill Lynch Capital Markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I have not told any of our investors to stay away from thebanks in general," she added.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But I have not received too manyinquiries by prospective buyers lately either."</sentence>
		<sentence>Traders said debt securities of U.S. banks that areperceived by investors to be heavily exposed to Latin Americandebtor nations declined moderately in price last week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Theysaid the difference between bids and offers widened.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There is not much trading of bank issues these days," anunderwriter said, referring to the wider bid/offer spreads.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, he and others pointed out that the secondarymarket has not seen heavy selling by institutions, funds andother investors.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The selling has been steady over the past couple of weeks.</sentence>
		<sentence>But it has been far from panicky," said another trader.</sentence>
		<sentence>In addition, institutional sources told Reuters on Fridaythat Salomon Brothers Inc lowered its investment ratings on thestocks of all U.S. money centers.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the sources said it isunderstood the action is not a sell recommendation.</sentence>
		<sentence>While institutional sources said Salomon lowered theratings to M from O-plus on bank stocks, bond traders said thiscarried over to the secondary market and further underminedconfidence in bank paper.</sentence>
		<sentence>The banks affected by Salomon's change in investment codingwere Bank of New York Co Inc <BK>, Bankers Trust Co <BT>, ChaseManhattan Corp <CMB>, Chemical New York Corp <CHL>, Citicorp<CCI>, Irving Bank Corp <V>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC>,J.P.

		<sentence>The institutional sources said Salomon cited a filing withthe Securities and Exchange Commission by Citibank, the leadbank of Citicorp.</sentence>
		<sentence>Citibank said Friday it told the SEC its earnings could bereduced by 50 mln dlrs after-tax in the first quarter, and 190mln dlrs in the year, if it has to declare 3.9 billion dlrs ofmedium- and long-term Brazilian loans non-performing.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I believe there will be some renegotiation along the waybetween Brazil and the banks such that the banks will not haveto charge off their loans to Brazil," Merrill Lynch's Neuhauscommented.</sentence>

		<sentence>The yield and premium overTreasuries was greater than a similar financing in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>On January 22 Nabisco sold 500 mln dlrs of same-maturity,same-rated sinking fund debentures priced to yield 8.62 pct, or107 basis points over the 9-1/4 pct Treasury bonds.</sentence>
		<sentence>Both issues were rated A-1 by Moody's and A by S and P.    Bond traders noted that Nabisco has called for redemptionaround 1.2 billion dlrs of its 11.20 pct notes of 1997.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nabiscowill buy them back at 107.50, traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The redemption of an attractive double-digit yield issueshas tainted Nabisco in investors' eyes," said one trader.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Obviously, a lot of prospective buyers believe Nabisco shouldpay a higher yield because of that."</sentence>
		<sentence>Traders also asserted that the higher yield in Friday'spricing reflected the total debt issuance of one billion dlrsso far this year by Nabisco.</sentence>

		<sentence>Since December, nearly five mln French investors havebought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA> and glassmaker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA <SGEP.PA>, the first two statecompanies brought to the stock market under the 300 billionfranc five-year privatisation plan.</sentence>
		<sentence>Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports ofcapital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money hasflooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to liftthe market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct sinceDecember.</sentence>
		<sentence>At the end of last year the government abolished pricecontrols that had existed for 42 years on services such as carrepairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention smallbusinesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.</sentence>
		<sentence>The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer pricesin January, partly responsible for a forced revision in theofficial 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct orless.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when youconsider that prices are now free for the first time since1945," commented Develle of Paribas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other achievements include a major reduction in the state'sforeign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target anddown from 153.3 billion in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and agradual improvement in industrial productivity, the Frenchfranc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliatingthree pct devaluation against the West German mark, its secondsince Chirac took power.</sentence>
		<sentence>A recent report by the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development pilloried French industry forfailing to produce the goods that its potential customerswanted.</sentence>
		<sentence>Outside the mainly state-controlled high technologysectors, French industrial goods were "increasingly ill-adaptedto demand" and over-priced, the report said.</sentence>
		<sentence>French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreedwith the report.</sentence>
		<sentence>"One of the assumptions of the government isthat if you give them freedom, the employers will invest andmodernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they likefreedom, and then wait to be told which way to go," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>And despite rising industrial investment and theintroduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.</sentence>
		<sentence>The problem for the government is that there may be littlemore it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>French producers failed more than most to take advantage oflast year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on theshaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries likeWest Germany and Japan, they say.</sentence>

		<sentence>With the April 15 tax return deadlineless than a month away, confused taxpayers will be convergingon H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer areexpected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a"bonanza," analysts say.</sentence>
		<sentence>"For the short term the key word is confusion, Block VicePresident Tom Bloch said in an interview.</sentence>
		<sentence>"When Congressdrastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparersbenefit," Bloch said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and placethem side by side to compare them, more people will throw theirhands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'" he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Tax forms will look very different next year," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block'sfiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains overfiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share onrevenues of 606.7 mln dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>He estimates Block's fiscal 1987earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Next year, Block could have a bonanza," Buchbinder said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Based on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show again of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Inthe 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns,up 1.5 pct over the previous year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mlnindividual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 taxseason, up from last year's 94 mln forms.</sentence>
		<sentence>Professional taxpreparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, accordingto the IRS.</sentence>
		<sentence>For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bringclients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide,there are some changes in the act that will have a negativeeffect, Bloch conceded.</sentence>
		<sentence>Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the taxreturn, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>Inaddition, some low income wage earners will be taken off thetax rolls, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try tooffset some of the negatives.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last tax season, the average costfor each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73dlrs worldwide, Bloch said.</sentence>
		<sentence>This tax season, rates will be upabout three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Block expects "some expansion" this tax season of itselectronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS andcan speed up the refund process.</sentence>
		<sentence>Block can choose where and byhow much it wants to expand into the seven cities madeavailable for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directlyfiled this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected inthe 1986 tax season.</sentence>
		<sentence>First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Blockwill benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about thesame as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs fortelevision ads.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They may get a little more bang for theirbuck," he said.</sentence>

		<subject>TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR FIGHT IN U.S. CONGRESS</subject>
		<sentence>U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for ashowdown between protectionists and free traders as a majortrade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by thefull House of Representatives in late April.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a keyHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned down version oflegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices.</sentence>
		<sentence>This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional effortsto restore competitiveness of American industries and turnaround last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made toomany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to backamendments to "get tough" with countries that violate tradeagreements or keep out U.S. products.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegianceto free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much intrade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiatingpowers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee'sbill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse inall respects," but he emphasized there was a consensus amongtrade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicanswould ultimately endorse.</sentence>
		<sentence>Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, "to make ourtrade policy stronger without violating our international tradeagreements.</sentence>
		<sentence>You'll find a lot of people who think we have notdone the former enough.</sentence>
		<sentence>You'll find poeple who think we haven'tavoided violating agreements."</sentence>
		<sentence>In a key concession made at the urging of the powerfulchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the tradesubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forcedReagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on importsfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices.</sentence>
		<sentence>It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it wouldhurt the U.S. economy.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an IllinoisDemocrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary ifthe House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of atough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and thisyear only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when hesaw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.</sentence>
		<sentence>As an indication of his success, White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration stilldid not like some provisions.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he added, "Generally we feelvery good about the bipartisan consideration of the tradelegislation.</sentence>
		<sentence>I think we are progressing very well."</sentence>
		<sentence>The first battle will take place next week when the fullHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries suchas Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluseswith the United States.</sentence>
		<sentence>The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide onlythat the existence of a large trade surplus with the UnitedStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,but would not automatically set off retaliation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch freetrader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.</sentence>
		<sentence>Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief fromimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.</sentence>
		<sentence>AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered theadministration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan wouldsign would not be worth passage in Congress.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in astatement, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please LaneKirkland.</sentence>
		<sentence>I'm trying to write legislation that will be signedby the president."</sentence>
		<sentence>In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls fortrade relief for specific industries such as textiles.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to holdoff his fight.</sentence>
		<sentence>He intends to push separately a bill to protectthe domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reaganvetoed a similar measure last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of themost influential proponents of aid for specific industriesbeset by low priced foreign competition.</sentence>
		<sentence>Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for thedomestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senateplan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when importsreach half of domestic consumption.</sentence>
		<sentence>For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S.enforcement of trade laws.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bill forces the administrationto act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such asdumping products in the United States at prices below the costof production.</sentence>
		<sentence>It also forces the administration to act rapidly when anindustry complains that a surge in imports threatens itsexistence.</sentence>

		<sentence>As one factor behind the anticipated loss, Endotronicscited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors, <YamahaInc>, over payment of a 3,686,000 dlr promissory note.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accountsreceivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and anotherJapanese distributor during the company's 1986 fiscal year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operationsit will exhaust all currently available cash and creditfacilities in early May 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said this assumes full use ofthe remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of creditfrom Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp<CZ>.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company said its ability to obtain funding wasadversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of itsshareholders seeking to represent a class of holders againstthree officers of Endotronics.</sentence>
		<sentence>Endotronics said the complaint against it allegesviolations of the federal securities laws in connection withstatements made in the company's annual and quarterly reports.</sentence>

		<sentence>The investigations willhurt the company's ability to obtain funding, it said.</sentence>

		<subject>SWISS OPTIONS, FUTURES EXCHANGE PLANNED FOR 1988</subject>
		<sentence>Preparations for the launch of a Swissoptions and futures exchange, billed as the first completelyelectronic market of its kind, are at an advanced stage,according to members of the project team.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex)is a new departure in that it will introduce an additionalrange of financial instruments and electronic trading methodsto the traditionally conservative Swiss market.</sentence>
		<sentence>There will be no physical exchange floor and both tradingand clearing systems will be completely automated.</sentence>
		<sentence>The new market, due to start operating in January 1988,follows a series of innovations by the bourses in Zurich, Basleand Geneva aimed at preventing loss of business in the face ofkeen competition from London and Frankfurt.</sentence>
		<sentence>These innovations included the introduction last October ofcontinuous trading in major shares, plans to establish a singlecontinuously updated Swiss share index from next month tosupplement the various indices produced by the major banks atthe close of business, and experiments in electronic trade.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banks themselves last year took the initiative of launchingcovered warrants on shares of other Swiss companies.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If Switzerland wants to maintain and expand itsinternational prominence in portfolio management, our bankersand fund managers must have the same modern instruments attheir disposal as their competitors," says Soffex presidentRudolf Mueller, a director of Union Bank of Switzerland.</sentence>
		<sentence>The computer terminals on which business will be conductedwill be confined to Switzerland.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is still unclear how manySwiss-based institutions will seek membership of the exchange.</sentence>
		<sentence>Formal applications are not due until next month but apreliminary survey completed by the Soffex project team thisweek showed strong interest in membership.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The response from both Swiss and foreign institutions allover the country has been very encouraging," says PhilippeBollag of the project team.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hans Kaufmann, who follows Swiss equities for Bank JuliusBaer, says a regulated traded options exchange should boostforeign interest in Swiss shares and possibly increase bourseturnover generally.</sentence>
		<sentence>The possibility of protecting portfolios by hedging shouldattract Swiss institutional investors, Kaufmann added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Soffex is a private company set up by the five major Swissbanks and the bourses of Zurich, Geneva and Basle.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trading will initially be limited to stock options on 10 to15 leading Swiss bearer shares.</sentence>
		<sentence>An options contract on the newSwiss share index should follow within six months but tradingin financial futures will be delayed until an unspecifiedfuture date.</sentence>
		<sentence>Options on foreign shares may also be added later.</sentence>
		<sentence>Participants will be either brokers or dealers, operatingin the market through computer terminals in their own offices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trading must be conducted exclusively through the exchange.</sentence>
		<sentence>Exchange membership is open to banks, traders and brokeragefirms with an office in Switzerland, while clearing membersmust be recognised as banks under Swiss law.</sentence>
		<sentence>The trading system, based on Digital Equipment Corpsoftware and hardware, provides display of best bid and offerprices, matches orders electronically, allows anonymousnegotiation of block orders and maintains member order books.</sentence>
		<sentence>An "interest" facility, aimed at helping participants togauge the market mood, shows the number of users watching aparticular instrument at any time.</sentence>
		<sentence>Most of the electronicclearing functions will be carried out overnight.</sentence>
		<sentence>Each contract will cover only five shares instead of the100 shares normally traded on existing options and futuresmarkets in the United States, London, Amsterdam and Stockholm.</sentence>
		<sentence>This reflects the fact that Swiss shares often costthousands of francs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bearer shares in F. Hoffmann-La Roche undCo AG, likely to be on the Soffex opening list, were quotedthis week at 209,000 francs each.</sentence>
		<sentence>Contracts will initally be offered for the three end-monthsfollowing the trading date plus the subsequent January, April,July or October end-months.</sentence>
		<sentence>Longer maturities may be added infuture if market liquidity permits.</sentence>
		<sentence>Detailed provisions have still to be worked out in areassuch as margin requirements, position limits, the supervisoryand regulatory functions of the exchange and brokerage fees.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banks polled by Reuters in a random survey wereenthusiastic about Soffex but reticent about the level of theirown involvement and about the exchange's prospects for success.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We're moving into completely new surroundings and it willrequire a change in psychology," said a securities dealer at amajor Swiss bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We in Switzerland are not used to sitting allday at a screen where nobody shouts at you."</sentence>
		<sentence>Moving into traded options will also require considerableinvestment in equipment and staff by participants.</sentence>

		<sentence>Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producerdelegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking ata lunch.</sentence>
		<sentence>After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries thismorning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it wouldvote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries.</sentence>

		<sentence>"The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20years, and dropped every time.</sentence>
		<sentence>What we want now is to kill itonce and for all," Bennett added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying, the U.S.Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliatewith penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, hesaid.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY</subject>
		<sentence>The European Monetary System marks itseighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world moneymarkets despite creating an island of currency rate stabilityin Europe, economists say.</sentence>
		<sentence>But many economists say the system,which holds eight European Community currencies within narrowfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.</sentence>
		<sentence>Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), hasbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alikeseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu asEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming realitywhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.</sentence>
		<sentence>But economists say members such as West Germany have so farblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system'sfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt andformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under this phase, originally due to have started two yearsafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have beentransferred from national governments and central banks to anautonomous European Monetary Fund.</sentence>
		<sentence>But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty ineconomic and monetary matters.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The basic problem of the EMS isthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to asituation where certain decisions are taken in common," said oneeconomist who has closely watched the system's development.</sentence>
		<sentence>The result is that the EC is often divided over policy onthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is thesystem's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged andinvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharprise of the West German mark severely strained the system.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend theEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major worldcurrency, outside the system.</sentence>
		<sentence>No change in the British government's attitude is expectedbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since itwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC'shighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of CentralBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.</sentence>
		<sentence>Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministershold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.</sentence>
		<sentence>But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involvemore than tinkering with technical details.</sentence>
		<sentence>They are scepticalabout the chances for any fundamental change.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMSagainst external factors such as dollar weakness.</sentence>
		<sentence>For that wemust take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leode Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists say the system's fortunes now will dependlargely on the success of an agreement last month among majorindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates.</sentence>

		<sentence>Congressional investigators of theIran-contra scandal have tentatively agreed to grant immunityfrom prosecution to a star witness --President Reagan's formernational security adviser John Poindexter, congressionalsources said today.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sources told Reuters the chief counsels of the two specialcommittees probing the two-year episode that has darkened theWhite House image plan to take their preliminary accord tocourt-appointed special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, possiblytoday or tomorrow.</sentence>
		<sentence>The tentative accord follows weeks of negotiating withWalsh and with committee members.</sentence>
		<sentence>Poindexter would be the highest ranking official to begranted immunity in the investigations of the 1985-1986 armssales to Iran to gain release of hostages held in Lebanon andthe clandestine shifting of arms profits to arm U.S.-backedrebels in Nicaragua, at a time aid would have been illegal.</sentence>
		<sentence>If the agreement --reached on Friday by Arthur Liman andJohn Nields, chief legal advisors of the Senate and Housecommittees respectively --is ratified as expected by Walsh andthe full committees, closed door interviews could be held withPoindexter in two months with public testimony in about 90 daysor mid June, sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They have tentatively reached an agreement and are supposedto meet with Walsh or his deputies," a source told Reuters ofthe deliberations by the two chief counsels    Sources said Poindexter could assist investigatorsdetermine what Reagan knew about the diversion of funds fromarms sales to Iran to rebels in Nicaragua, if anything.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan has denied knowing about the shift of funds althoughhe has admitted he gave orders to sell arms through Israel ineither August or after the first shipment in September 1985,but can't remember when.</sentence>
		<sentence>Congress was kept in the dark aboutthe affair until last autumn.</sentence>
		<sentence>"He will be a credible witness," one source said of thepipe-smoking Poindexter.</sentence>
		<sentence>Besides Reagan's knowledge, or lack of it, another keyunanswered questions lingering from earlier congressionalinvestigators and a special presidential review board, is whoreceived  millions of dollars from clandestine arms profits.</sentence>
		<sentence>So far the money trail uncovered by probers stops at secretSwiss and Cayman Islands bank accounts.</sentence>
		<sentence>The committees have been privately negotiating with Walshover the immunity matter, and the prosecutor, also called anindependent counsel, has been urging the committees to hold offon their request for at least 90 days.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the tentative accord, the wishes of Walsh could bemet since public testimony is not expected before 90 days.</sentence>
		<sentence>Poindexter, a Navy vice admiral, along with his fireddeputy at the National Security Council, Marine Lt. Col. OliverNorth, have refused to testify before investigators,claiming their fifth amendment rights against selfincrimination.</sentence>

		<subject>SPAIN TO RELAX EXCHANGE CONTROLS</subject>
		<sentence>The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchangecontrols to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing withEuropean Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for theending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The measures to take effect by June were designed to liftrestrictions on foreign currency operations, in line withderegulation in the banking industry," he said in a telephoneinterview.</sentence>
		<sentence>The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controlshighlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence>The central bank said in a statement the measures includedincreased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provisionfor future pension fund obligations.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulateSpain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into theCommunity last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, aprocess that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreignbanks to open branches.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market andthey now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreigncurrency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against aprevious ceiling of 750 mln pesetas.</sentence>
		<sentence>The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March.</sentence>
		<sentence>Between thatdate and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into thecountry on new foreign currency loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billionpesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would begiven clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days.</sentence>
		<sentence>Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreigncurrency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, byissuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper.</sentence>
		<sentence>They can also employ these funds to invest in foreignissues, while before they had to be converted into deposits.</sentence>
		<sentence>Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies,instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency.</sentence>
		<sentence>The central bank has also lifted the restriction on theamount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limitedto three times a bank's capital equity.</sentence>
		<sentence>The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by mostbankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month whichimposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible pesetafunds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>The reserve requirement, which was already in place onnormal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreignspeculative capital which is entering the country andthreatening the government's money supply growth target.</sentence>
		<sentence>A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which nowaccount for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at adisadvantage with European competitors.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government reduced fixed asset investment requirementsto 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact ofinterest rate deregulation.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The real problem is the freeing ofinterest rates," the banker said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This is going to take a bigbite out of profits."</sentence>
		<sentence>The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paidon deposits of up to 180 days.</sentence>
		<sentence>The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said themeasure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits thisyear.</sentence>

		<sentence>"We need to and will make the effort (to solve the debtproblem) but we cannot make an effort that means we stopgrowing," he said, adding that political and not purelycommercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil, whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largestin the developing world, has been under pressure from officialand private creditors to work out an economic adjustmentprogram with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreignpayments problems.</sentence>

		<subject>AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92</subject>
		<sentence>A 0/92 program would have verylittle impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle onlyan additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, accordingto a report from the Agriculture Department.</sentence>
		<sentence>The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acresidled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mlndlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause verylarge acreages to be removed from crop production is quitesmall," the report said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The returns on typical farms still favor participation inthe usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permittedacreage," the USDA report said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to foregoplanting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,would be most used by producers in high production/high riskareas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,director of USDA's economics analysis staff.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that muchparticipation," Collins said.</sentence>
		<sentence>USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheatwould be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.</sentence>
		<sentence>Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushelsof sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales ofcotton, the report said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In determining whether to participate, a producer wouldneed to weigh the expected cash costs of production against theloan rate ...</sentence>
		<sentence>The risk that market prices may rise above theexpected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must beconsidered," according to the analysis.</sentence>
		<sentence>"What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference betweenthe loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said.</sentence>
		<sentence>For producers with low production costs, that difference isgreater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go alongwith 0/92.</sentence>
		<sentence>But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be moreattractive.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would bemore incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal atfirst, but it is a step towards the goal of separatingproduction decisions from government payments," Collins said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a speech earlier today before the National Grains andFeed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is toolate to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup willbe over by the end of this month.</sentence>

		<sentence>Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock overre-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986,and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue.</sentence>
		<sentence>Arango said that government measures adopted here lastweek, including a lower export registration price, indicated amajor change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This is the start of a new era in Colombia because worldmarket conditions are also new," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government lowered local taxes for exporters and saidthe export registration price, or reintegro, will be changedmore often in order to closely reflect market trends.</sentence>
		<sentence>Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude wasthe decision on Friday to open export registrations for anunlimited amount.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavyselling of coffee.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Our marketing policy is to sell without haste butconsistently.</sentence>
		<sentence>No targets for volume will be set.</sentence>
		<sentence>We will reactto market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention ofgiving its coffee away."</sentence>
		<sentence>Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcomingexports, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags butneither are we going to sell like mad.</sentence>
		<sentence>The trade knows fullwell what Colombia's export potential is," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags,exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee yearwhich ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictionsbut said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would notexceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by theNational Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S.Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was "ridiculous."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in thenumber one producing province of Antioquia, meant output waslikely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare andoscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango saidColombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managedto force a compromise.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and headof his nation's delegation in London, has blamed theintransigence of some big countries, without naming them.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister CesarGaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United Stateswould undoubtedly be under great political pressure in comingweeks to revise its policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Washington will have to take into account that for manycountries, and some of its allies for instance in CentralAmerica, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would havefar-reaching political and economic consequences."</sentence>
		<sentence>Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on exportquotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve whichcould emerge from continuous contacts.</sentence>

		<subject>ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION</subject>
		<sentence><Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move uniqueamong Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold globalexpansion that could someday lift the foreign share of itsyearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.</sentence>
		<sentence>First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analystMichael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target isattainable.</sentence>
		<sentence>But it "will be a tremendous achievement because... they're going to have to build an international earningsbase larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestictrust companies," Walsh said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growththis year against an expected 15 pct jump in total companyprofit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.</sentence>
		<sentence>Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company withassets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operatedinternationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, whenother Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings andloans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heighteneddomestic competition and impressive growth at its London bankoperations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980,Cornelissen said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe andAsia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow ChemicalCo <DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included assetmanagement, merchant and private banking companies.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It was a heaven-sent opportunity," Cornelissen said of theDow Financial acquisition.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We achieved in one year what wouldotherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up."</sentence>
		<sentence>Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun directcompetition with major global financial institutions inactivities such as international lending and stock brokerage,in order to exploit "profitable niches" overseas in traditionaltrust activities such as asset management, private banking andadvisory services.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations"before the end of this month" to sell its London-based SavoryMilln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The international market is so big and we have such aminiscule share of it that growth opportunities are reallylimited only by our energy and our desire to find morebusiness," he said, adding that in trust-type services, "wedon't think the international markets are well-served."</sentence>
		<sentence>Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadianinvestment abroad, Cornelissen said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapideconomic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, saidCornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billiondlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.</sentence>
		<sentence>Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asiawill contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct ofglobal productive capacity, Cornelissen said, "We knew we hadto be there."</sentence>
		<sentence>Royal Trust's 14 international locations includeoffices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company alsorecently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Royal Trust president said the company was stressinggrowth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee anyacquisitions in the "immediate future," although "we have oureyes wide open for the right opportunities."</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which thecompany abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units,Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market wellcovered by hundreds of small regional banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>"That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,"said Cornelissen.</sentence>
		<sentence>"That is probably one area that we willprobably do something with in the next five years."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the company would continue to emphasize its homeCanadian market, which Cornelissen and financial servicesanalysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.</sentence>
		<sentence>Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks,trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation inone another's actitivies will mean more domestic competitionfor Royal Trust, "but not drastically more," Cornelissen said.</sentence>

		<sentence>The federal Food and DrugAdministration's Dermatologic Drugs Advisory Committee votedunanimously that Upjohn Co's Rogaine baldness drug was safe andeffective.</sentence>
		<sentence>The panel recommended that the FDA approve Rogaine formarketing in the United States, so long as accompanyingpackaging and promotional materials disclose that the producthas only limited effect on male pattern baldness.</sentence>
		<sentence>The five outside experts attending today's FDA committeemeeting seemed less concerned about Rogaine's safety after anoutside consultant told them the drug "appears to be quite safein the normal male population."</sentence>
		<sentence>The consultant, Ohio State University Professor of MedicineCarl Leier, said Rogaine's side effects were minimal, based ona study of 10,000 individuals who have been getting the drug inCanada, where it was approved for marketing last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Canadian record is quite a good one in terms of sideeffects," Leier said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The experts urged the FDA to require a warning in thedrug's packaging that patients be monitored for heart effectswhile taking the drug, such as irregular heart beats, changesin heart rate, palpitations and fluid retention in the body.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rogaine, whose chemical name is minoxidil, has already beenapproved by the FDA when taken orally as a high blood pressuredrug.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Upjohn is now seeking agency approval of it as a malebaldness treatment when put directly on the skin in liquidform.</sentence>
		<sentence>Upjohn has previously claimed that, when applied to thescalp, too little of Rogaine was absorbed into the bloodstreamto affect the heart.</sentence>
		<sentence>But panel members concluded that the amount absorbedmerited physician monitoring of patients taking the drug.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under questioning by panel members, Upjohn official RichardDe Villez acknowledged the drug in clinical trials producedmoderate hair growth on the crown of the head in only about 40pct after 12 months.</sentence>
		<sentence>He also acknowledged discontinuing treatment would make thenew hair fall out.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Upjohn problem is that they have a tremendous placeboeffect," panel member Paul Bergstresser of the University ofTexas told the meeting.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said patients administered a placebo during clinicaltrials typically had about half as much new hair growth as didindividuals treated with Rogaine.</sentence>
		<sentence>As a result, it may take patients eight-12 months beforethey can tell whether thay are benefiting from the drug, hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>In Canada, a year's treatment costs about 550-640 dlrs(U.S.).</sentence>
		<sentence>An Upjohn official said no price would be set for the drugin the U.S. market until it was approved for sale.</sentence>
		<sentence>During trials, the drug was found to have a bizarre sideeffect on some individuals: It caused a state of sexualdysfunction known as "exagerrated erection."</sentence>
		<sentence>Stewart Ehrreich, a former FDA official who conducted asafety review of Rogaine before leaving the agency, saidresearchers had found a number of cases of patients who hadexagerrated erections as a result of the drug.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said this was a common effect for drugs of the sameclass as Rogaine, called vaso-dilators.</sentence>
		<sentence>FDA officials said they could make no prediction on whenRogaine might be approved for marketing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Following the vote, panel member Dr. Robert Stern, a Bostondermatologist, said Upjohn statistics had exaggerated theeffect of the drug.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said "about one in five will have a substantial clinicaleffect," which he defined as a significant growth of new hairthat made the patient actually look better.</sentence>
		<sentence>He urged insurance companies not to cover the cost ofRogaine treatment in order to preserve scarce medical fundresources.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I would hope that insurance companies will take a strongline that this is not a product we will reimburse for," Sterntold reporters.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think this is a drug that has some application for somepeople, and I think some people will find it worth the expense,"he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he said individuals should be required to pay for thetreatment out of their personal funds.</sentence>

		<sentence>FRN dealers said at least 10 houses did not open forbusiness with many market operators pausing to assess theirnext steps in the wake of Friday's huge drops and panictrading.</sentence>
		<sentence>Despite some late signs that prices were recovering lastweek, today's erratic trade provided a similarly mixed finalpicture with longer-dated FRNs still clearly under pressure.</sentence>
		<sentence>While FRN specialists noted that paper on which coupons areshortly due to be refixed had managed to hold up today, as hadnotes paying a relatively higher margin, longer term FRNs werestill subject to intense selling pressure.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Anything longer than 10 years is still being sold offseriously, as is just about any paper in the banking sector,"one FRN market source at a leading U.S. House said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He noted that one long-dated Citicorp issue -- paper whichhas suffered recently on fears over Latin American debtexposure -- slipped by two points to around 94.00.</sentence>
		<sentence>FRNs, whosecoupons are refixed regularly, usually trade around par.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. And Canadian bank paper was still generally underpressure, as was Republic of Ireland paper, due to renewedworries about the Irish economic situation.</sentence>
		<sentence>The malaise was felt through the banking sector with a twopoint fall registered by one BNP note, to give a three pointdrop over two trading days.</sentence>
		<sentence>Retail clients, usually seen returning to the market asprice falls push yield margins up to these attractive levels,have been unnerved by the last three days' panic, dealers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Yes, there's been some bargain hunting, but no one dares tobe first to come seriously back in," said one dealer.</sentence>
		<sentence>"A handful of market giants have frightened the retail awaywith this aggressive manipulation.</sentence>
		<sentence>As true liquidity drains, weare going to have to see some better market cooperation andrationalisation," commented one FRN trader now dealing withstraight bond issues since the floater market crisis.</sentence>
		<sentence>This view was shared by the majority of FRN market sourcespolled by Reuters since trade began to collapse last week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Of the 50 or so houses who have up until now made a marketin floaters, dealers estimated that around a dozen did notquote FRN prices today and they reported that one or two houseswere not expected to resume trade in the securities at all.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many called meetings to assess the current marketsituation.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Given the potential volatility of this market -- one whichhas been conclusively proved by the events of the last days --senior management are now duty bound to revise the set ofparameters within which they, as market makers, are now towork," commented one senior source at a leading U.K. Investmenthouse.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, there were no reports that a formal crisis meetingof market makers -- such as that called in December last yearduring the perpetual FRN market collapse -- was on the cards.</sentence>
		<sentence>Several firms were expected to cut back drastically on thelist of FRNs traded, with most volatile paper first to go.</sentence>
		<sentence>Elsewhere in the eurobond market, business was extremelyquiet, with virtually no activity seen in the dollar straightsector which has been becalmed of late, traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There has been no real two-way business today, neither hasthere been any new issues for diversion," noted one trader.</sentence>
		<sentence>"All we have seen today is some squaring up of positions,"she added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Investors remain cautious of the dollar, whichthough recently stable, still has potential downside risk.</sentence>
		<sentence>Eurosterling, the market sector which, aside from the FRNs,has been in the headlines lately, was quiet today ahead of theU.K. Government budget due to be announced tomorrow.</sentence>
		<sentence>Undertone was very firm with dealers expecting a positivefiscal package tomorrow and, if not more good economic news toboost sterling, at least confirmation of the bull factors whichhave bolstered eurosterling and gilt-edged bonds lately.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It was just sit and wait today but I expect it will be fullsteam ahead on Wednesday," commented one sterling market source.</sentence>
		<sentence>Prices showed gains to 1/8 to 3/8 point across the board.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers said several new eurosterling issues were currentlyin the pipeline and an early issue is expected to be for amajor European bank which currently has a mandate in themarket.</sentence>

		<sentence>He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise histarget for 1987 after the February monthly result of between0.1 to O.2 pct, following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pctyear on year) that forced the government to revise an earliertarget of two pct to a current 2.5 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said he was happy with "a good result" for February butstressed a need for continued "vigilance" against inflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Finance Ministry statement said the year-on-yeardifferential between French and lower West German inflationrates, calculated on the last three months, had narrowed inFebruary to two to 2.3 pct compared to 2.7 pct in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>If calculated on the last 12 months, the differential cameto 3.9 pct, the statement said, adding "The tendency istherefore one of a lessening of the inflation gap with our maintrading partner."</sentence>

		<sentence>Norway's parliament has approved anextensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners akey loophole through which controversial oil shipments onNorwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway's minorityLabour government, gives domestic companies until lateSeptember to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa andNamibia.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The legislation discussed today must not be seen as anisolated measure, but as a step in an international process,"Norway's foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament.</sentence>
		<sentence>Government officials said they hope the move will intensifyinternational pressure against the Pretoria regime's apartheidpolicies.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to haltall trade with South Africa by October.</sentence>
		<sentence>Norway's boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipmentsto South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an importantexception for ships whose final destination is decided whilethey are at sea.</sentence>
		<sentence>Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading,making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships' finalport at the start of a voyage.</sentence>
		<sentence>Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continuedoil shipments to South Africa.</sentence>
		<sentence>They called for strictersanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa.</sentence>
		<sentence>Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pctof its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade hasdropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,trade ministry officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from SouthAfrica dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eightmonths of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crownsfrom the year-ago figure.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Many would say that the law has already had its effectbecause of the dramatic drop in trade between South African andNorway," Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuringits relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law.</sentence>
		<sentence>"No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect oninternational trade with South Africa, but it is an importantpolitical statement by the Norwegian government," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Oslo government said it will review the effects of theban on Norwegian industry after two years and may proposeamendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law.</sentence>
		<sentence>Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly tohigh-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in itferro-alloys and light metals industries.</sentence>

		<subject>TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U.S. HOUSE</subject>
		<sentence>U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for ashowdown between protectionists and free traders as a majortrade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by thefull House of Representatives in late April.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a keyHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version oflegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional effortsto restore competitiveness of American industries and turnaround last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcementof trade laws.</sentence>
		<sentence>The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly oncomplaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping productsin the United States at prices below cost of production.</sentence>
		<sentence>Italso forces the administration to act rapidly when an industrycomplains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.</sentence>
		<sentence>In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls fortrade relief for specific industries such as textiles.</sentence>
		<sentence>Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made toomany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to backamendments to "get tough" with countries that violate tradeagreements or keep out U.S. products.</sentence>
		<sentence>But congressmen known for their allegiance to free tradesaid the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputesand they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was notone "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,"but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to worktoward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.</sentence>
		<sentence>The goal of trade legislation was "to make our trade policystronger without violating our international trade agreements,"he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and MeansCommittee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the tradesubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forcedReagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on importsfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices.</sentence>
		<sentence>It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation ifit would hurt the U.S. economy.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach wasnecessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would signinto law.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a toughHouse trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year heonly reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he sawDemocratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.</sentence>
		<sentence>White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters latelast week that the administration still did not like some ofthe bill's provisions, but he added, "Generally we feel verygood about the bipartisan consideration of the tradelegislation.</sentence>
		<sentence>I think we are progressing very well."</sentence>
		<sentence>The first battle will take place next week when the fullHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, SouthKorea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide onlythat the existence of a large trade surplus with the UnitedStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,but would not automatically set off retaliation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief fromimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.</sentence>
		<sentence>AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered theadministration when he said any trade bill Reagan would signwould not be worth passage in Congress.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate bysaying, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please LaneKirkland.</sentence>
		<sentence>I'm trying to write legislation that will be signedby the president."</sentence>
		<sentence>Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a billto protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aidesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the mostinfluential proponents of aid for specific industries beset bylow-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call forimport relief for the domestic oil industry and announced hissupport for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil importtariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.</sentence>

		<subject>ATT <T> MAY FACE STRUGGLE OVER DEREGULATION</subject>
		<sentence>American Telephone and Telegraph Comay have a hard time convincing U.S. regulatory authoritiesthat lifting controls on its long-distance business willbenefit consumers, industry and congressional analysts say.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There's clearly going to have to be an effort (by ATT) tosay that deregulation will not have an adverse effect on theconsumer," said Gerry Salemme, a policy analyst for the Housetelecommunications, consumer protection and financesubcommittee.</sentence>
		<sentence>Salemme said that if the Federal Communications Commissioneased restrictions on ATT, Congress probably would considertaking legislative oversight action to protect consumers'interests.</sentence>
		<sentence>ATT has about 80 pct of the interstate long-distancemarket.</sentence>
		<sentence>It asked the FCC to cut back price and rate regulationsthat have control its long-distance phone business.</sentence>
		<sentence>ATT spun off its local telephone services operations intothe seven regional Bell companies in 1984 as part of the  courtordered breakup of the telephone giant.</sentence>
		<sentence>The regional companies have been prohibited frommanufacturing equipment and from offering information servicesand out-of-region long-distance service.</sentence>
		<sentence>But some of them want to move into those areas,particularly the provision of long-distance services, whichwould compete directly with ATT.</sentence>
		<sentence>ATT's request came in response to an FCC notice issued inJanuary that proposed to streamline regulation of certain partsof its long-distance business.</sentence>
		<sentence>The FCC will closely examine the potential effects of theproposal on consumers, said FCC spokeswoman Mary Beth Hess.</sentence>
		<sentence>"That would be foremost in our mind," Hess said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hess said she expected the FCC to respond in a few months.</sentence>
		<sentence>Congressional aides said they were concerned that ifregulation is reduced, ATT will use its dominant marketposition to raise consumer rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumer groups say ATT's concern for its business clients,its most lucrative market, underscores a danger that, withoutfull regulation from the FCC, any increased costs will bepassed onto the consumer rather than big business.</sentence>
		<sentence>ATT, however, says deregulation would benefit consumers.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company would become more competitive because it wouldnot have to wait for FCC authorization before introducing newservices, spokeswoman Edith Herman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation ofAmerica, which represents more than 200 consumer groupsnationally, said, "When ATT offers new services, they tend to begeared toward the high volume business market rather than theaverage consumer."</sentence>
		<sentence>ATT proposed that in addition to lifting profit regulation,the FCC allow new rates to go into effect in 14 days instead ofthe current 45 days.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company also called for a reduction in the amount ofdocumentation it must file with the FCC each time it introducesor changes long-distance services.</sentence>
		<sentence>"With this filing, we're suggesting that regulators replacea blanket approach to regulating ATT with a more finely-tuned,targeted approach," said Lawrence Garfinkel, AT&T's vicepresident of marketing services, in a statement.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We believe that by using a scalpel instead of a meat axe,the public interest can be protected and all consumers willbenefit," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>MCI Communications Corp, also asked the FCC to easerestrictions on ATT, saying this would encourage competition.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some industry analysts said the MCI proposal was an effortto halt FCC-mandated price cuts that have forced ATT and itsrivals to cut prices, eroding profits in the industry.</sentence>
		<sentence>MCI lost448.4 mln dlrs on sales of 3.59 billion dlrs last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The analysts said the proposal would benefit MCI becauseATT would no longer impose price cuts that MCI would have tofollow when costs fell in the industry.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I'm sort of mystified by those comments," retorted Herman, adistrict manager for ATT.</sentence>
		<sentence>"ATT (if deregulated) has no intention of not passing oncost reductions," she added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation,said he opposed deregulation because it left no alternativesthat would ensure against overcharging by ATT.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the FCC had in the past instructed ATT to reduceprices when the company was benefitting from lower costs fromincreased use by consumers of long-distance services.</sentence>
		<sentence>Without full regulatory authority this may no longerhappen, he added.</sentence>

		<subject>SEC OKAYS BOESKY FIRMS' MOVE TO PROTECT FUNDS</subject>
		<sentence>The Securities and ExchangeCommission approved a request by two firms controlled by insidetrader Ivan Boesky that allows them to take steps to protecthundreds of millions of dollars from potential claimants.</sentence>
		<sentence>The SEC granted requests made by Seemala Partners L.P. andIFB Managing Partnership L.P., to withdraw as registeredbrokers, effective March 12.</sentence>
		<sentence>With the action, the partnerships are no longer subject tothe SEC's net capital rules requiring them to remain solvent asbrokerage firms.</sentence>
		<sentence>Seemala argued the move would be necessary ifnoteholders of Ivan Boesky and Co L.P. are to be repaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>In asking the SEC to speed its withdrawal as a registeredbroker, Seemala said it wold repay to Boesky and Co, which isalso controlled by the former Wall Street arbitrageur, 660 mlndlrs in subordinated debt, plus accrued interest.</sentence>
		<sentence>IFB Managing Partners, which was also given approval towithdraw as a broker, has no significant assets, the SEC said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Once it is repaid, Boesky and Co will pay 200 mln dlrs insenior participating notes and 440 mln dlrs in subordinatedparticipating notes of Hudson Funding Corp to certainnoteholders, Seemala told the SEC.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the planned repayment scheme, Seemala told the SECthe noteholders would forgo claims of prepayment penalties andsome additional interest amounting to more than 100 mln dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>The plan would be in the public interest, Seemala argued,since the noteholders, many of which are savings and loaninstitutions and insurance companies, would receive repaymentof the principal on their notes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Seemala also argued that the plan would help the limitedpartners of Boesky and Co, who were not charged in the Boeskyinsider trading scandal, by protecting its remaining equityfrom the noteholders' claims.</sentence>
		<sentence>Unless the Boesky firms are allowed to complete therepayment plan, Seemala said Boesky and Co noteholders wouldseek total claims of 116.8 mln dlrs, plus 9.2 mln dlrs to 10.6mln dlrs a month in addition, in addition to other claims.</sentence>
		<sentence>Such claims could wipe out Boesky and Co's assets beforeother creditors can establish their claims, Seemala said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The only opposition to Seemala's Feb 12 request to withdrawas a broker came from Berger and Montague P.C., counsel for theplaintiffs in a class action suit against Seemala and otherdefendants.</sentence>
		<sentence>The suit involves charges stemming from Boesky'sinsider trading in the stock of several major companies.</sentence>
		<sentence>Berger and Montague told the SEC it opposes the Seemalaproposal because it would allow Boesky and Co noteholders tosettle their claims ahead of the plaintiffs in the class actionand because Seemala did not disclose the total amount of claimsagainst it and what percentage defrauded investors would get.</sentence>
		<sentence>Seemala has said that its repayment scheme would leave apool of about 278 mln dlrs free of claims from Boesky and Conoteholders which could satisfy other claimants.</sentence>
		<sentence>The pool would be in addition to funds placed in escrowunder insider trading settlement agreements, including 11.4 mlndlrs from Dennis Levine and 50 mln dlrs from Boesky.</sentence>
		<sentence>In approving the request, the SEC barred Seemala and Boeskyand Co from making any distributions to its limited partnersfor one year and required limited partners who receivedistributions to agree to make themselves liabile up to a pointin any case filed the partnerships.</sentence>
		<sentence>The SEC also required Seemala and Boesky and Co to getconfirmation of their assets from a nationally recognizedaccounting firm.</sentence>
		<sentence>The agency said Boesky and Co and existing and potentialclaimants against it have similar interests in eliminatingmajor creditors and preserving assets for future claims.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. MONEY MANAGERS MAY LEAN TO STOCKS VS BONDS</subject>
		<sentence>U.S. money managers and investmentadvisors said they expect stocks to continue to outperformbonds, but some are hedging bets by keeping roughly half ofportfolios in bonds and cash for quick investment shifts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Merrill Lynch said its new asset mix report due today willurge weightings of 50 pct stock, 35 pct bonds and 15 pct cashversus 40 pct bonds, 35 pct stock and 25 pct cash previously.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We believe an overweighting in stocks is warranted becauseof the positive momentum of corporate earnings," said ChristineLisec-Tinto, Merrill senior investment strategist.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lisec-Tinto, who formulated Merrill's latest asset mixrecommendations with new chief investment strategist CharlesClough, said there may be some consolidation of recent stockprice gains, but the market appears to have good potential.</sentence>
		<sentence>Through Friday, stock prices as measured by the Dow JonesIndustrial Average surged 19.13 pct in 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, the Shearson Lehman Treasury bond price index edged up 0.4 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We believe that the equity market has much more upsidepotential than the bond market," Chrysler Corp <C> treasurerFred Zuckerman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said "interest rates are not comingdown and I would not bet a lot that they will come downsharply."</sentence>
		<sentence>Chrysler's 3.5 billion pension fund last week sold 405 mlndlrs of corporate bonds in the first of two planned sales ofslightly less than one billion dlrs of corporates.</sentence>
		<sentence>Zuckerman told Reuters the proceeds will be used to buystock to bring equities to 50 pct or more of the portfolio.</sentence>
		<sentence>A roughly even bond/stock portfolio split also is urged byWright Investors Service, with 4.25 billion dlrs undermanagement, but it is more optimistic on bonds than stocks.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We'd put half in bonds and half in equities now," saidJudith Corchard, Wright senior vice president.</sentence>
		<sentence>She said thebond share was lifted from 35 pct in the last three months.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The stock market has appreciated sharply and discountedfuture corporate earnings extensively," Corchard said.</sentence>
		<sentence>She said"we're worried about a stock price correction of as much as 10to 15 pct within six, or possibly even three months."</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, Wright expects bonds to benefit from a half toone percentage point decline in interest rates by year's end.</sentence>
		<sentence>"At this level of the stock market, there is more of anadvantage to being in long-term bonds than in equities, givenour interest rate scenario," Corchard said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The stock market has come a long way in a short time.</sentence>
		<sentence>I'dbe hardpressed to jump into stocks with the Dow near 2300unless I was really convinced that earnings and multiples willincrease," said a fixed-income securities portfolio manager ata major money center bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the bank has kept bond/equity portfolio mix fairlystable recently and probably will make no major changes formonths as it awaits economic, oil price and dollar trends.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We've seen no real movement from bonds to stocks among ourfunds," said George Collins, president of T. Rowe PriceAssociates, with 22 billion dlrs in assets under management.</sentence>
		<sentence>While he detected no rush into stocks from bonds, eitheramong the many mutual funds under the T. Rowe Price umbrella oramong outside money managers, Collins thinks stocks are betterinvestments than bonds at this time.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In the near term, the stock market has more prospects forgrowth, due to the mixed signals on the economy so far, theslim chance the Federal Reserve will ease policy and stillheavy debt accumulation," Collins said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He expects U.S. stocks to improve further because there ismore corporate earnings potential, nominal interest ratesalready are low and there is strong foreign demand for stock.</sentence>
		<sentence>Collins said that in funds which include bonds and stocks,the firm has long maintained an aggressive 75 pct weighting inequity with the rest in bonds and cash.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Our equity managers have taken a slightly heavier cashposition in equity portfolios lately," Collins said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Cash" in portfolios usually means short Treasury billswhich can be readily sold to allow rapid investment shifts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many portfolio managers are working with relatively highcash positions in equity accounts, often 25 to 30 pct, given  the belief that there may well be downward price correctionsenroute to higher ground.</sentence>
		<sentence>In bond portfolios, the money managers generally showed apreference for shorter term (10 years and under) Treasury notesand, to a lesser extent, agency securities, rather thanlonger-dated Treasury issues and corporate bonds.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since yield premiums of corporate over Treasury bonds arenow the lowest in years, many investors believe corporates areovervalued versus Treasury and agency issues.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another negativecited for corporate bonds is the risk of hostile takeovers,leveraged buyouts and sudden ratings declines that does notexist with Treasury or Federal agency securities.</sentence>

		<sentence>"I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement withFujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal inthe works," said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst withL.F. Rothschild.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There are unquestionably other buyers out there," addedKidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney.</sentence>
		<sentence>"A lot of companies havelooked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it."</sentence>
		<sentence>Among the companies that would be interested in bidding forFairchild are Advanced Micro Devices <AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif.,and LSI Logic Corp <LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analystssaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp <NSM>,Texas Instruments Inc <TXN> and Motorola Inc <MOT> might alsoseek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrustproblems, the analysts added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to beconsidering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,Calif., company, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a brief statement announcing the termination of theagreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision openedup other possibilities, including a possible buyout byFairchild management.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu wouldhave bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,because rising opposition to the deal by the Reaganadministration made it unlikely that the sale could becompleted within a reasonable period of time.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing thatthe companies did not need government approval to complete thetransaction.</sentence>
		<sentence>Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-ownedcompanies.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal becausethe U.S. government didn't want it," said Johnson of L.F.Rothschild.</sentence>
		<sentence>A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on thecompany's news release.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said only that the company was reviewing a number ofpossible alternatives for the Fairchild unit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediatelyavailable for comment.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts noted the significance of the government'sapparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control ofFairchild.</sentence>
		<sentence>Administration officials, including Commerce SecretaryMalcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese controlof key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and militaryweapons systems.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The government really stood up for the semiconductorindustry," said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild.</sentence>
		<sentence>"That, I think, isthe real significance of this."</sentence>

		<sentence>The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would nothave to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash.</sentence>

		<sentence>Latin America urgently needs more moneyif it is to grow its way out of its deepening debt crisis, butfresh ideas about how to stimulate new lending quickly seem tobe in short supply.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers, officials and academics at a conference organizedby the Massachusetts Institute of Technology stressed theimportance of proper economic policies and increased privateinvestment.</sentence>
		<sentence>But they offered no glimpse of a grand design tobanish the specter of a widespread repudiation of the region's380 billion dlr debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Such a solution is still not in sight,"said Nobel Prize-winning economist Franco Modigliani.</sentence>
		<sentence>The conference was held against the background of therecent suspension of interest payments by Brazil and Ecuador,but it was Argentine finance secretary Mario Brodersohn whospelled out most clearly the social and economic strains causedby the need to service billions of dlrs of debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brodersohn, who is negotiating currently with foreign banksfor a 2.15 billion dlr loan for 1987, says Argentina will haveto grow at a four pct annual rate between now and 1992 simplyto restore per capita income to the level of 1975.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the investment needed to fuel this growth can comepartly from structural economic reforms at home, but this alonewill not be enough.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We have to reduce the transfer of resources," Brodersohnsaid, adding that mounting economic strains in Latin Americamake this a matter of urgency.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brodersohn and other Latin officials, however, did notspell out how this should be achieved.</sentence>

		<sentence>But there was a widespread recognition at the conferencethat the Baker Plan has fallen well short of expectations.</sentence>
		<sentence>Miguel Urrutia, a senior official of the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank, for instance, said IADB lending had actuallydeclined in 1986 and had started slowly in 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>Mexico is due to sign a 7.7 billion dlr loan on Friday thatwill be the first major facility under the Baker Plan, whichcalled for net new bank lending between 1986 and 1988, a targetthat Morris Goldstein of the International Monetary Fund saidis now optimistic.</sentence>
		<sentence>Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-AmericanAffairs Paul Taylor acknowledged that the Baker Plan "has notyet succeeded as well as we hoped."</sentence>
		<sentence>But if the debtors at the conference were hoping to hear anofficial commitment to try a new tack, they must have beendisappoiunted.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ted Truman, director of the International Finance Diviisionat the Federal Reserve Board, said banks were short-sighted innot lending promptly and in the amounts called for by Baker.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said some streamlining of the lending process may beneeded, but added, "I see no alterantive to the present courseof responsible cooperation."</sentence>
		<sentence>A major theme at the conference, however, was that theworld economy might not continue to cooperate while the debtorsand creditors muddle along.</sentence>
		<sentence>If export markets dry up because ofrecession or protectionism, speakers warned, Latin America willbe even more hard-pressed to service its debts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rimmer de Vries, chief international economist at MorganGuaranty Trust Co, said he was very concerned that worldeconomic growth of three to 3-1/2 pct cannot be sustained andthat West Germany and Japan wowuld not take up the slack in theworld economy that will arise as the U.S. narrows its tradedeficit.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There's a deflationary force coming down the mountain, andI don't know who's going to be rolled over," de Vries said.</sentence>

		<sentence>The European Community's (EC)executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of itsambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farmsurpluses, after strong attacks from northern states.</sentence>
		<sentence>Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands andDenmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats whichhas already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC ledby the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen toldjournalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree thetax, proposed last month as part of the Commission's annualfarm price package, would leave a large hole in the group'sbudget.</sentence>
		<sentence>He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mindup for good.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I hope the debate is still open, if not there willbe a formidable hole in the budget," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 andwould be only slightly less this year, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax aheadof farm ministers in a move described by diplomats asunprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministersrecognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extracash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levelsand to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption bymaking it more competitive with other oils.</sentence>
		<sentence>Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oilproducers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by thetax.</sentence>
		<sentence>"What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be betterunderstood not just outside the community but at home," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in theEC's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal toimpose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fatscould seriously damage the EC's trade relations with othercountries.</sentence>
		<sentence>Britain also warned that the tax could hit developingcountries already receiving aid from the EC, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Commission also defended proposals to dismantleMonetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross bordersubsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuationsfor farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to ECexecutive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clearsuch a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism atthe talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany hadbeen alone in its opposition.</sentence>
		<sentence>The question was a key aspect ofthe Commission's farm price proposals, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid theEC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portugueseopposition.</sentence>
		<sentence>The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes ofunwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning itinto animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out ofsavings from another plan to curb milk production.</sentence>

		<sentence>Fears of renewedinflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers generally doubted whether any economic packageJapan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce itstrade surplus significantly, and said such measures wouldprobably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package ofmeasures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boostdomestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.</sentence>
		<sentence>But debate on the budget has been delayed by an oppositionboycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed impositionof a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slimchance of producing a meaningful economic package in the nearfuture, the dealers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in theU.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure onthe dollar, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changedsince before the Paris accord, they added.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due toa still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debtcrisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interestpayments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of theReagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra armsscandal," said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.</sentence>

		<sentence>Dlrs, stock analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earningsof between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reportsresults tomorrow for its first year as a public company.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, madeits earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation inMay last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, makinga total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in theprospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said the airline's performance improved in the secondhalf of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mlndlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to oneU.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company'sfavour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the timeof the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the1985 level.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said a one pct movement in fuel prices wouldaffect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profitsof 1.25 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price andcurrency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.</sentence>

		<sentence>The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact onthe company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel pricesusually lag behind crude price movements by several months,analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against theHong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct andsterling 12 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar againstCathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yieldsin the first half up 7.2 pct," said James Capel.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This shouldcontinue through the second half to enable passenger yields toend the year up 7.6 pct."</sentence>
		<sentence>A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cashunder management also improved profits, James Capel said.</sentence>
		<sentence>A general improvement in air traffic last year contributedto Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factordeclined because of increased competition and an expansion ofits fleet and services.</sentence>
		<sentence>James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flownlast year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flownclimbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fellto 68.8 pct from 70 pct.</sentence>

		<sentence>"All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvestarea, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice andhigh-yield cash crops," it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>It added factory production might have to be reduced toprovide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fightthe drought.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since January, the press has devoted much attention tograin, stressing that growth in output is vital to China'seconomic and political stability and that prices paid tofarmers are too low.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grainproduction is a key state policy and outlined the measuresbeing taken in their areas to encourage output.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct ofthe pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidiseagriculture.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said rural industries in other suburbs also setaside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the70,000 workers available to help farmers.</sentence>

		<subject>FAIRCHILD DEAL FAILURE SEEN MAKING JAPANESE WARY</subject>
		<sentence>Schlumberger Ltd's <SLB.N> decision toend an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> to buy80 pct of its <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, and the politicalfurore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanesecompanies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. Hightechnology firms but will not halt such attempts, industryanalysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow toFujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Expansion bythe Japanese firm, said analysts polled by Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu'sNorth American operations, but it would have been a greatboost," James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said.</sentence>
		<sentence>French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was endingthe agreement because mounting political controversy in theU.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stakecould be completed in a reasonable time.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department andDefence Department, partly on national security grounds.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given theJapanese computer maker control of a comprehensive NorthAmerican sales and distribution system and access tomicroprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak,analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additionalmicrochip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in theU.S., A report by the Capel firm said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and amarketing channel for other things," said Barclays de Zoete Weddanalyst Rick May.</sentence>
		<sentence>Several analysts said the purchase would not have givenFujitsu access to critical defence technology.</sentence>
		<sentence>"(Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's athing of the past," May said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu asit might have had to spend several hundred million dollars tomodernise Fairchild's production lines, Capel's Murtha said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanesefirms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. Hightech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costlyroute of expanding its own production and distributionfacilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use theestimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try toacquire some less politically symbolic firm.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but thenecessity of expanding their production and design capacity inAmerica remains," said Capel's Murtha.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Japanese willcontinue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to findones that are politically acceptable."</sentence>
		<sentence>Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures orsmaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlashthat blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They're notgoing to slow up, they're just going to buy smaller pieces ...Because of the political risk," said Barclays de Zoete's May.</sentence>
		<sentence>Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pctshares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as superminicomputer makers, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end upharming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinationaltie-ups, some analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either," saidJardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Thepooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move --why should the government step in to prevent it?"</sentence>
		<sentence>Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry HajimeTamura told a press conference that interference by U.S.Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matterfor governments' comment," Tamura said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think it was improperfor U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent theydid," he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, butStandwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-ZambiaRailway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually allZambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARAline to Dar es Salaam for the last three months.</sentence>
		<sentence>During that period no Zambian copper had been shippedthrough Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the onlyother available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambianmineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, headded.</sentence>
		<sentence>Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and PresidentKenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vitalfor his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding thetraditional route through South Africa.</sentence>

		<sentence>Kaunda said that once preparations had beencompleted for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe anddependable routes his government would look to increase itsusage of TAZARA for other types of cargo.</sentence>
		<sentence>The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run MetalMarketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metalexports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus79 pct in 1985.</sentence>

		<sentence>Bankers in Saudi Arabia are negotiatinga delicate balance between western business practice andoriental justice as they try to restructure the troubledcorporate sector's debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>The problem lies in reconciling Saudi Arabia'swestern-style banking system and an Islamic, "Sharia" legalsystem in which interest payments may be viewed as usury andillegal.</sentence>
		<sentence>So Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks have pinned hopes onnegotiated settlements rather than enforced ones, and areresigned to not being able to recoup loans in full.</sentence>
		<sentence>And they have become highly selective over enterpriseseligible for new credit after a run of failures that forcedheavy loan loss provisions and ate relentlessly into profits.</sentence>
		<sentence>As a result, they have attracted complaints from a businesscommunity that says it is starved of funds while the governmentis criticising it for not playing a larger role in the economy.</sentence>

		<sentence>Bloated inventories and in some cases poormanagement created problems.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some also blamed the governmentfor not paying for public sector contracts promptly.</sentence>
		<sentence>Long negotiations to reschedule some debt are now producingresults.</sentence>
		<sentence>One banker said, "Banks are agreeing reschedulings, butoften at a high price...</sentence>
		<sentence>They are resigned to the fact thatfull recovery (of loans) is not always possible."</sentence>
		<sentence>In a few cases private sector firms have been stripped ofassets during or prior to debt renegotiations, leaving banksvirtually no hope of repayment in full.</sentence>
		<sentence>The first major rescheduling was not sealed untilmid-February this year when <Arabian Auto Agency>, known asAAA, reached agreement to stretch out repayments of 700 mlnriyals of debt to some 50 Saudi and international banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers said the deal for the Jeddah-based heavy equipmentimporter is likely to set a precedent for the private sector.</sentence>
		<sentence>It was greeted with relief after 18 months of negotiations.</sentence>
		<sentence>AAA's rescheduling has been followed in the last few daysby a draft accord on the 1.3 billion riyal debt of one of theKingdom's most publicised companies, <Saudi Research andDevelopment Corp>, REDEC.</sentence>
		<sentence>These two cases have raised hopesthat other companies will also reach agreement soon.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers said the cement importer <Arabian Bulk Trade>, andthe construction and trading firm <Ali and Fahd ShobokshiGroup> are still negotiating with creditor banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>They are increasingly resigned to there being little legalrecourse in Saudi Arabia, and that rescheduling with paymentsgeared to a company's cash-flow -- often very low -- is theonly way to recover at least a portion of outstanding loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Though bankers feel they generally have the tacit backingof the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), the Kingdom'scentral bank, some say it should take a more active role.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, bankers said it is encouraging SAMA has notblocked a "black list" of borrowers banks have drawn up andcirculated for over a year.</sentence>

		<sentence>Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish,and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japantakes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Parisaccord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of150.00 yen and to fall even below that level," a senior dealerat one leading bank said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable ataround 151.50 yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>Six major industrial countries agreed at ameeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fears of renewedinflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers generally doubted whether any economic packageJapan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce itstrade surplus significantly, and said such measures wouldprobably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package ofmeasures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boostdomestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.</sentence>
		<sentence>But debate on the budget has been delayed by an oppositionboycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed impositionof a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slimchance of producing a meaningful economic package in the nearfuture, the dealers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in theU.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure onthe dollar, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changedsince before the Paris accord, they added.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due toa still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debtcrisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interestpayments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of theReagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra armsscandal," said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline toaround 140.00 yen by the end of this year," said Chemical BankTokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.</sentence>
		<sentence>But operators find it hard to push the dollar either wayfor fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S.Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask forquotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollarwhen it rose to 1.87 marks.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in Londonwhen it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of centralbank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's declinebecause many dealers are likely to await such dollar buyingintervention as a chance to sell dollars.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branchassistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said "The dollar will notshow drastic movement at least to the end of March."</sentence>
		<sentence>Other dealers said the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Seems unwilling to see anystrong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their booksfor the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollarwould give Japanese institutional investors paper losses ontheir foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest inpurchases of U.S. Treasury securities.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD</subject>
		<sentence>The Japanese economy will remain sluggishin the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for12 years in 1986, private economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand,was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing andbusiness investment would help sustain the economy this year,the economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agencyreport today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Decquarter for the first time in 12 years.</sentence>
		<sentence>The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in theprevious quarter.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from4.7 pct in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Agency officials said this was the worstperformance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wakeof the first oil crisis.</sentence>
		<sentence>They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline inconsumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it wasonly temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather haddepressed retail sales.</sentence>
		<sentence>But most private economists disagreed and said consumerswere likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they sawtheir real income level off.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes orheating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, butthey have done so because they have become even more uneasyabout their future pay rises," said Shoji Saito, general managerof Mitsui Bank's economic research division.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries, particularly those hithard by the yen's rise.</sentence>
		<sentence>Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, saidweakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor.</sentence>
		<sentence>Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achievedomestically generated economic growth as the government hasput a lid on fiscal measures, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered inOct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, includingexceptionally heavy spending in the public sector.</sentence>
		<sentence>JohsenTakahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute,said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Decresulted from an issue of gold coins.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect thathigh level of public-sector consumption in the followingquarter," Takahashi said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Agency officials said public spendingwould have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, whichmarked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.</sentence>
		<sentence>Takahashi said the economy might contract in the currentquarter given the lack of additional significant governmentspending and sluggish consumer spending.</sentence>

		<sentence>Data on the U.K.'s public sectorborrowing requirement has boosted hopes of a large fiscaladjustment for the coming financial year, broking and bankinganalysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some analysts say that the Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson may announce this afternoon a total of up to sixbillion stg in tax cuts and lower government borrowing targets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Total PSBR in the first 11 months of the fiscal year of 100mln stg compares with a projected seven billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>Forecasts hadgenerally been for a net repayment in February, but the 300 mlnstg repayment was toward the better end of expectations.</sentence>
		<sentence>March is usually a high-spending month, boosting the 11month figure at the end of the fiscal year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nevertheless,Lawson is expected to downwardly revise the 1986/87 PSBR latertoday.</sentence>
		<sentence>Until now, only the more optimistic forecasts put Lawson'sroom for manoeuvre as great as six billion stg for 1987/88,with many favouring a four billion of five billion package.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Bill Martin, economist at brokers Phillips and Drew,said a six billion stg adjustment now looks within range, splitbetween three billion off the PSBR and three billion off taxes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Malcolm Roberts, of Salomon Bros International, also saidsix billion was within a credible range of forecasts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Roberts added that he was now expecting Lawson to have atleast five billion stg available following this morning's data,against his own previous estimates of around four billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said today's 11 month PSBR figure was genuinely low,rather than distorted by unusual factors, which fuels pressureon Lawson to reduce next year's borrowing target.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, heforecast a March 1987 PSBR of 3.5 billion stg.</sentence>
		<sentence>Peter Fellner, of brokers James Capel, cautioned that sixbillion still looks on the high side of expectations.</sentence>

		<sentence>However, IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chileanand Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987to be much lower than the 651,000 tonnes produced in the lastquarter of 1986, due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile forthe month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peruin the same month.</sentence>

		<sentence>Copper shares, which have laggedbehind the market, should pick up steam this year on strongerdemand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Copper prices should move up over the next four to sixquarters," said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co <MER>.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Isee average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up fromaround 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued worldeconomic growth."</sentence>
		<sentence>Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts apound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp <PD> will be a strongperformer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Asarco Inc <AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales fromcopper, and Newmont Mining Corp <NEM> are also potentialwinners, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of itscopper operations to its shareholders.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In theory, Phelps is the best stock.</sentence>
		<sentence>It's the purest playand benefits most from higher copper prices," one said.</sentence>
		<sentence>William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co,said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined miningoperations.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They've accomplished a great deal," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company's move into carbon black, a product used intires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapidgrowth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrsin 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean WitterReynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps.</sentence>
		<sentence>Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 andfour dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs thisyear and around 3.50 dlrs next year.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The stock can go to the mid 30s," Roling said, from itscurrent level of around 30.</sentence>
		<sentence>But others see it climbing to 40.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don't needcopper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money," saidVahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. "The shares willoutperform the market over the next 18 months," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc saysNewmont Mining is a more attractive investment.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We'd ratherplace our bets with Newmont.</sentence>
		<sentence>Any way you slice it, I see asignificant premium to the current stock price," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont willhave gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co<NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations,Toufexis noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40dlrs from operations in 1986.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. BANKING REGULATION</subject>
		<sentence>U.S. banks are under pressure tomeet vigorous competition, but Congress continues to duck hardchoices on banking law reform that could benefit consumers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Supporters say deregulating banking will increasecompetition, offer consumers more choices and bring lower feesfor financial services and home mortgage interest rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the Senate Banking Committee last week put off untillater in the year decisions on pressing issues such as whetherbanks could enter new businesses like underwriting corporatedebt and selling insurance and real estate.</sentence>
		<sentence>The committee also reined in banks' competitors, theso-called nonbank banks, which elude the technical definitionof a bank because they do not both accept deposits and makeloans.</sentence>
		<sentence>The committee meeting room became a battleground forgiants of the financial industry -- banks, brokerages,insurance firms, retail and industrial corporations -- with butlittle consideration given to the consumer.</sentence>
		<sentence>The lobbies backed various amendments to protect their turfand a bill that rescues a federal deposit insurance fund forthrift institutions and puts a moratorium on any changes inbanking law was passed and sent on to the full Senate.</sentence>
		<sentence>The House of Representatives has yet to act.</sentence>
		<sentence>Behind the political deals was the larger question whetherCongress would end or modify the half-century-old separation ofcommercial and investment banking or leave it alone.</sentence>
		<sentence>One argument in support of change is that fees forfinancial services would come down if Congress expands banks'powers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lower fees to underwrite mortgage-backed securities, forexample, could lead to lower interest rates on home mortgages,supporters say.</sentence>
		<sentence>"A lot of nonbanking firms have used loopholes to get intobanking, but banks have not be allowed into any new businesses,"says Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We have been seeing a gigantic turf war," says Litan, whofavors new powers for banks if deposits are safeguarded.</sentence>
		<sentence>The swirl of corporate mergers and the financialinformation explosion have blurred the distinction between theactivities of banks and security brokerages.</sentence>
		<sentence>On a wider horizon, U.S. financial institutions facestepped-up competition from financial centers like London andTokyo in international transactions.</sentence>
		<sentence>West German and Japanese banking is more concentrated in afew, large banks, while most European countries allow bankingand securities to be mixed.</sentence>
		<sentence>All these forces put pressure on U.S. financial firms toadapt to change, but the congressional debate over reform dragson.</sentence>
		<sentence>The committee's bill put a freeze on any changes and itschairman, Senator William Proxmire, promised to return theissues in October.</sentence>
		<sentence>If approved by Congress, the bill wouldpostpone applications before the Federal Reserve for new powersto three of the largest banks -- Citicorp, J.P. Morgan andBankers Trust.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other industries where regulatory barriers have fallen haveexperienced lower fees, the emergence of new players andaccelerated innovation.</sentence>
		<sentence>But these advances in airlines, trucking, andtelecommunications have not been without drawbacks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Companiesthat were slow to adapt disappeared under the new competitiveregime, while the public faced a bewildering number of newchoices.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Reagan administration favors bank reform.</sentence>
		<sentence>The traditional method companies use to raise funds --borrowing from banks -- has given way to selling corporate debtand other new securities that are off limits to banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>But critics say the soundness of the banking system createdby such laws as the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act would beundermined.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banks are treated as special and shielded from themarketplace's vagaries by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp (FSLIC) performsthe same function for thrifts.</sentence>
		<sentence>The one issue the committee did act on which benefitsconsumers is new funding for the federal insurance fund fordeposits at savings and loan associations, which has fallen toits lowest ratio of reserves to deposits in history.</sentence>
		<sentence>Despite efforts toward change in Congress, a ban oninterstate banking remains.</sentence>
		<sentence>The barriers are crumbling anyway because statelegislatures are agreeing to permit bank mergers across statelines within a region.</sentence>
		<sentence>Congress is proceeding cautiously, having in mind thebanking industry's tribulations in the early 1930's.</sentence>

		<sentence>EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan'scontinued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to makea greater effort to open up its markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>They also said theywere disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress thatwould impose permanent quotas on textile imports and wereprepared to react.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S. Administration has alreadydistanced itself from the bill.</sentence>
		<sentence>EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has writtento his U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,outlining the EC's concerns.</sentence>
		<sentence>The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S.Moves towards protectionism.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The adoption of such measureswould not fail to have a negative effect on the process ofmultilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateralrelations," it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option butto react according to the laws of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers saidthey "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance intrade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more."</sentence>
		<sentence>The statement said the EC would continue to insist thatJapan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare areport on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable themto take appropriate action where necessary.</sentence>
		<sentence>One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministerswere determined not to let the Japanese question drop.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It willbe back on the table again and again," the diplomat said.</sentence>
		<sentence>De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said,"There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within theCommunity concerning trade relations with Japan."</sentence>
		<sentence>But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyoto solve the problem rather than embark on a costly anddamaging trade war, and the ministers called for morecooperation with Japan in industry and research.</sentence>

		<sentence>Livestock analysts expect renewed bullspreading in live cattle futures following yesterday's USDA7-state cattle on feed report.</sentence>
		<sentence>The USDA reported high placements in February, which mayweigh on back months of cattle futures.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, continuedstrong marketings during the month will support the Aprilcontract.</sentence>
		<sentence>Contracts for June delivery forward could open 25 to 50cents lower while April will likely open about steady, analystssaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cheap corn is still the main incentive for putting cattleon feed, according to Smith Barney livestock analyst TomO'Hare.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They have no place to send the grain," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Strong daily fundamentals may add to nearby support whilethe current discount of deferred months to the cash market mayoffset much of the effect of the report, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The cash market is strong and may overshadow the report,"said Robin Fuller, analyst for Agri Analysis.</sentence>
		<sentence>She added thateven though placements came in above the average trade guess,many traders had expected high placements.</sentence>
		<sentence>Placements are not that negative, especially since thetechnical correction in June and August live cattle futuressince last week, GH Miller analyst Jerry Gidel said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the current marketing posture will provide addedsupport to the nearby month.</sentence>
		<sentence>Feedlot marketings have beenrunning at a heavier than expected pace.</sentence>
		<sentence>Chuck Levitt, analyst for Shearson Lehman said that withthe number of cattle on feed down five pct at the beginning ofthe year, a three pct decline in marketings was expected.</sentence>
		<sentence>Butthe report for January showed marketings at 101 pct of a yearago and in February marketings were at 100 pct, Levitt noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>"So far we haven't seen any decline in marketings.</sentence>
		<sentence>They(feedlot operators) are marketing more cattle than they hadintended for the first quarter, which is a bullishdevelopment," Levitt said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gidel also noted that marketings for the early part ofMarch are running ahead of a year ago.</sentence>

		<sentence>The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid tosubsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECDsaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July thisyear and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixedcredits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct forcredits covering exports to the world's least developednations.</sentence>
		<sentence>Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculatingthe aid element in mixed credits, to take account of differentinterest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,which hosted the reform negotiations, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised tradeloans have also been revised with the aim of cutting thesubsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relativelyrich developing countries by July next year.</sentence>

		<subject>U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT</subject>
		<sentence>Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament,said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the Treasury expected a current account balance ofpayments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1billion shortfall in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of thisyear, Lawson said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation maycontinue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct bythe summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of theyear," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR),Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.</sentence>
		<sentence>The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.</sentence>
		<sentence>On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range forthe narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal1987/88.</sentence>
		<sentence>No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3aggregate, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But broad money will continue to be takeninto account in assessing monetary conditions, as of coursewill the exchange rate," the Chancellor told Parliament.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 "ischiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil taxrevenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by anincreasingly profitable business sector in particular."</sentence>
		<sentence>On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlierassumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs perbarrel in calendar 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said "it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil taxrevenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of theeconomy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts thepublic finances in a very strong position."</sentence>
		<sentence>Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at1.0 pct of GDP in future.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium TermFinancial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0pct of GDP.</sentence>
		<sentence>My aim will be to keep it there over the yearsahead," Lawson said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have thisyear for reducing the burden of taxation, which of courseremains a major objective of government policy."</sentence>
		<sentence>"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudenceand caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future."</sentence>
		<sentence>Lawson said the time had come to strike the ExchangeControl Act from the Statute book.</sentence>
		<sentence>On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchangedat 35 pct in 1987/88.</sentence>
		<sentence>But companies' capital gains will becharged at the "appropriate corporation tax rate."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said that under the new proposed system, companiesshould be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) paymentsagainst tax on capital gains.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in1988/89," Lawson said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lawson said he will propose that all companies and buildingsocieties be treated the same way on payment of corporationtax, "with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months afterthe end of the accounting period on which the tax is due."</sentence>
		<sentence>"I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a newmethod of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay andFile."</sentence>
		<sentence>This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining taxcollection, and would not come into force until the early1990s.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax(PRT).</sentence>
		<sentence>As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pctof the costs of developing certain new fields set against their(PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of thosenew fields exceeds the costs incurred.</sentence>
		<sentence>Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spendingon research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to anyparticular field.</sentence>
		<sentence>On business employment, Lawson said employers will receivetax relief for retraining workers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lawson said that in future, traders registered for ValueAdded Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the taxon the basis of cash paid and received.</sentence>
		<sentence>Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead ofquarterly.</sentence>
		<sentence>The VAT compulsory registration period was beingextended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholdsare to be raised to 21,300 stg.</sentence>
		<sentence>New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now beset at 125,000 stg.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companiesin multinational groups with dual residence will no longer beable to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment.</sentence>
		<sentence>The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but "genuinetrading companies" will not be affected.</sentence>
		<sentence>He also planned to end the present treatment of tax creditrelief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bankloans, also from April 1.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In future, banks will be able to offset this tax creditonly against tax on the profit on the relevant loan," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by twopence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basictaxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added "given my decisionto use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have toreduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget."</sentence>
		<sentence>Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to27 pct, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned tochange the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing itinto line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilitiesmade by ordinary insurance companies and of comparableprovisions made by financial traders.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently withLloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said.</sentence>
