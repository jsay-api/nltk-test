		<sentence>The London exchange is seeking clarification.</sentence>

		<subject>OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987</subject>
		<sentence>The 24 nations of the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered bysluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economicgrowth, and their joint balance of payments will swing intodeficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECDeconomic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a2.8 pct growth forecast in December.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and thesmaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardesthit by currency appreciation this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growthrate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct inDecember and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said it expected the OECD to post a current accountdeficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due inlarge part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely tofall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlrpayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomesincreasingly ragged.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline inforeign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on itstrade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after lastyear's 18.4 pct drop.</sentence>
		<sentence>The average mark/dollar rate is put at1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rateis expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with anaverage value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeperangle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireballrather than a three-point landing," the EIU said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and theFebruary meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five andCanada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift tomore expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighterU.S. Fsical policy," it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was thewillingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Governmentassets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, addingthat if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollarwould collapse.</sentence>
		<sentence>To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rateswould have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debtcrisis, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look"increasingly sick."</sentence>
		<sentence>Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seenslowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to4.2 pct in 1988, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The weakness of the West German economy is the biggestsingle factor, with import growth there expected to feature asluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast inDecember, the EIU said.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in WestGermany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, whileJapan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.</sentence>

		<sentence>Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehltold a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cutleading interest rates again if the United States makes asimilar move, banking sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposiumin Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pressrepresentatives were not invited.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rateswould give room for a matching measure in Germany.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates," saidone banker who attended the symposium.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have nocomment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.</sentence>
		<sentence>But, according to a second source, who also declined to beidentified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as adirect pointer to further moves by the central bank to defendGerman industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.</sentence>
		<sentence>"He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then theBundesbank would also drop them.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said that quite clearly,"the second source said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cutin the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after theU.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting todiscuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made sucha move in advance, the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, bycuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as earlyas last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying,"No, they wouldn't have been.</sentence>
		<sentence>We checked that."</sentence>
		<sentence>The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nationstook place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talksbetween central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, sayingthat financial markets had not fully realised the significanceof the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem furtherfalls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>For the first time all participants at the summit agreedthat a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for allworld economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boostedgrowing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised aroundcurrent levels by international central bank cooperation.</sentence>
		<sentence>One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the factthat the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodativein monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown inWest Germany's economic growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the paststressed that the German central bank had no directresponsibility for growth and was solely concerned withcombatting inflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tightermonetary stance from the beginning of December until thehalf-point cut in rates in late January.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the currentovershooting of the German monetary target would not directlyrespark inflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bundesbank was not obliged to reactimmediately whenever such overshooting occurs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank'smain measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.</sentence>

		<sentence>Dutch economic growth is slowing as afirming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industriesreduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planningagency CPB said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economicoutlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected togrow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increasefrom last year's 423.95 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value ofthe guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pctlast year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an averageof 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unitlabour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, whilethese are rising slightly in the Netherlands," the CPB said.</sentence>
		<sentence>More of economic growth now depended on domesticconsumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins setby domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect onpurchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, theCPB said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Inflation was zero last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by fivepct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth lastyear, the CPB said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue tocondition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recentyears, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact ofthese factors on Dutch competitiveness.</sentence>
		<sentence>In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and socialsecurity costs to employers.</sentence>
		<sentence>The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring downthe deficit and reduce tax and social security payments infuture.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dutch government revenue is being depressed further byfalling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 thisyear from 710,000 last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB iswithin its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to twopct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said inits February economic outlook that GDP growth at constantprices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analystshad expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its ownlatest estimate.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the wholedocument yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in someof our estimates," a Pierson economist said.</sentence>

		<subject>TECHNOLOGY/NEW ERA FOR INFORMATION HANDLING</subject>
		<sentence>Ground-breaking new systems for storingand retrieving information are ushering in a new era forcomputer companies and computer users.</sentence>
		<sentence>Within the past few weeks, International Business MachinesCorp <IBM>, Eastman Kodak Co <EK> and others have launchedproducts that radically increase the amount of data that can becatalogued and shelved in computerized libraries.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This flurry of new technology could yield systems thathandle a multimedia blitz of data," said Ian Warhaftig, asenior analyst with International Data Corp, Framingham, Mass.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We're developing new systems because our customers areasking for them," Peter Giles, vice president and generalmanager of Kodak's mass memory division, said in a recentinterview.</sentence>
		<sentence>This demand is expected to soar in coming years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Whileestimates vary, industry analysts project that providingproducts and services geared for information storage andretrieval could become a 20 billion dlr a year business by1995.</sentence>
		<sentence>A wide range of technologies will be needed to meet thevarying requirements of users.</sentence>
		<sentence>For example, a large credit verification service would wanta system from which it could quickly retrieve credit data andrelay it to its clients.</sentence>
		<sentence>A law firm, however, may need acomputerized law library in which capacity, rather than speed,is the key feature.</sentence>
		<sentence>For architects and engineers, the abilityto store photographs, sketches and other graphics would becrucial.</sentence>
		<sentence>Regardless of the specific application, the trend is towardconverting information - documents, video or film or even soundrecordings - into to the digital language of zeros and onesunderstood by computers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Saving space is the key goal in digitizing data forstorage.</sentence>
		<sentence>An optical disk the size of a standard compact diskcan store 550 megabytes of data, or about 250,000 pages oftypewritten text.</sentence>
		<sentence>For this reason, the compact disk read-only memory, orCD-ROM, is already a popular data storage media.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last week,Microsoft introduced Microsoft Bookshelf, a 300 dlr programthat contains, on a single CD-ROM disk, a dictionary,thesaurus, national ZIP code directory, Bartlett's FamiliarQuotations, the World Almanac and other reference works.</sentence>
		<sentence>Scores of such products are already on the market, but mostare specialty items, such as Lotus Development Corp's <LOTS>CD-ROM data base of stock information for financial analystsand investors.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Microsoft Bookshelf is important because itmarks the arrival of CD-ROM packages for the general public,"said Ian Warhaftig of International Data Corp.    One drawback of the CD-ROM, which uses a laser to recordand read data, is that that it requires a special player.</sentence>
		<sentence>CD-ROM players for the retail market will appear later thisyear.</sentence>
		<sentence>Moreover, IDC's Warhaftig said CD-ROM's will be integratedwith personal computers.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Eventually, CD-ROM's will fit right inside the PC box," hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Imagine the advantage of having a spelling checker andthesaurus at your fingertips when you're writing with a wordprocessing program."</sentence>
		<sentence>But CD-ROM's are just the beginning.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also last week, Kodakunveiled several systems that use 12-inch optical disks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Thelargest Kodak system uses a jukebox-like cabinet to hold up to150 optical disks from which data can be retrieved in a matterof seconds.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kodak also announced a 14-inch optical disk with 6.8gigabytes of memory, five times the memory of a CD-ROM.</sentence>
		<sentence>TheKodak disk, which will not be available until the middle of1988, is designed for users who need quick access to very largeamounts of data, said Kodak's Giles.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, N.V. Philips <PGLO.AS>, the Dutch electronicsgiant, is preparing to take optical disk technology a stepfurther with the first disk that can combine text, video andsound.</sentence>
		<sentence>Philips said the system, called Called CD-Interactive,will be ready next year.</sentence>
		<sentence>It will include a new kind of CD-ROMplayer that can hook up with a television set and stereo.</sentence>
		<sentence>Additional breakthroughs are expected as the nextgeneration of computer memory chips are introduced.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last monthIBM said it has made a four-megabyte chip, capable of storingmore data than eight CD-ROM's.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meantime, <Nippon Telegraph andTelephone> of Japan said it has built a 16-megabyte chip.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts say commercial versions of these chips are severalyears away, though some suspect that IBM may start volumeproduction of its four-megabyte chip sometime this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Such chips will enable computer makers to build computerswith immense memory capacities.</sentence>

		<subject>PAPER INSTITUTE SEES STRONG PAPER MARKET IN '87</subject>
		<sentence>The American Paper Institute said theindustry is headed for another year of record volume in 1987,with linerboard particularly strong.</sentence>
		<sentence>"A pro-growth trade policy, continued attention to currencymanagement, a fairly low interest rate climate and no major taxincreases are the essential ingredients in this outlook," RedCavaney, American Paper Institute president said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cavaney said that so far this year the industry'sperformance mimics last year's strength.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year, he said, paper and paperboard production hit arecord 71 mln tons, 5.9 pct above 1985's 67 mln tons, whileindustry after-tax profits in 1986 exceeded 1985 profits.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cavaney said that inventories will play a major role inthis year's performance.</sentence>

		<sentence>Cavaney added that as a result of slimmer inventories in1986 and in the early part of this year, shipments for 1987 asa whole will be higher than last year, even if demand slackens.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cavaney said, however, he expects demand this year to bestrong, spurred by consumer spending.</sentence>
		<sentence>The benefits of tax reform on individual after-tax incomeand consumer goods companies' cash flow, he said, will increasedemand for both communications paper and packaging this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>In addition, Cavaney said low mortgage rates should supporthigh levels of housing starts in 1987, increasing demand formany kinds of packaged goods.</sentence>
		<sentence>Inventory building should help demand for cartons andcorrugated containers this year, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cavaney said he expects exports to remain fairly high in1987, as well, as a result of the recent declines in the dollaragainst major world currencies.</sentence>
		<sentence>But more importantly, he said, an improved balance of tradein 1987 from the lower dollar would induce increased industrialactivity at home and thus higher packaging demand.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cavaney said increased competitiveness, caused by lowercosts, higher productivity and improved efficiency would alsocontribute to a strong showing from the industry this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cavaney said, however, that the Tax Reform Act of 1986could have a negative impact on the industry this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>"For manufacturers, the removal of the investment taxcredit creates an impediment to future investment," he said.</sentence>

		<subject>ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL</subject>
		<sentence>The suspension of Ecuador's crude oilshipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last atleast four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official said Ecuador could resume exports afterrepairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which linksjungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.</sentence>
		<sentence>It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.</sentence>
		<sentence>The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the12-point international Mercalli scale.</sentence>
		<sentence>The damage to thepipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oilaccounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as60 pct of government revenues.</sentence>
		<sentence>Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisationof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumpingabout 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpdabove the output quota assigned by the cartel, another EnergyMinistry spokesman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year, it exported an average of173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombianpipeline, the first official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He estimated it could takeabout 60 days to build.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the endof January, about equal to one month's imports.</sentence>
		<sentence>It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billiondlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>The country'stotal foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest inLatin America.</sentence>
		<sentence>In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela wouldloan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next threemonths to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic suppliesand would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela inrepayment in May, Lusinchi said.</sentence>
		<sentence>A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund MinisterHector Hurtado and including representatives from the interiorand defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos deVenezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate andco-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Southern Co said it will take anafter-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later thanJanuary 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclearpower plant has risen abover the amount which retail customersin Georgia will be asked to pay.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, saidthe budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mlndlrs, to 8.87 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, because of a pledge the madelast year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increasedcost will not be included in the utility's retail electricrates.</sentence>
		<sentence>Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduledcompletion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The utility said fuel loading has been completed at UnitOne and the unit is being put through a series of low-powertests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for afull-power license.</sentence>
		<sentence>The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., isco-owned by <Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal ElectricAuthority of Georgia and the city of Dalton.</sentence>
		<sentence>Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate wasdue to several factors, including additional labor costsincurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule forcommercial operation by June.</sentence>
		<sentence>The new figure represents thefirst change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when itwas estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would"cap" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to payat 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected8.35 billion dlr total.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the new budget, Georgia Powersaid, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a chargeagainst earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes.</sentence>
		<sentence>In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contractswith the joint owners require the utility to buy backsignificant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant'sinitial years of operation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under terms of the cap on costs, itwill not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increasethat applies to the buybacks.</sentence>
		<sentence>This bings the total amount that must be charged againstearnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Southern said new rules of the Financial AccountingStandards Board, which are effective in January 1988, requireany costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be chargedagainst earnings once that determination is made.</sentence>

		<subject>OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987</subject>
		<sentence>The 24 nations of the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered bysluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economicgrowth, and their joint balance of payments will swing intodeficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECDeconomic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a2.8 pct growth forecast in December.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and thesmaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardesthit by currency appreciation this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growthrate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct inDecember and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said it expected the OECD to post a current accountdeficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due inlarge part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely tofall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlrpayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomesincreasingly ragged.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline inforeign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on itstrade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after lastyear's 18.4 pct drop.</sentence>
		<sentence>The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this yearand 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to breakthrough the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angleof descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball ratherthan a three-point landing," the EIU said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and theFebruary meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five andCanada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift tomore expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighterU.S. Fiscal policy," it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was thewillingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Governmentassets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, adding thatif Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar wouldcollapse.</sentence>
		<sentence>To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rateswould have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debtcrisis, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look "increasinglysick."</sentence>
		<sentence>Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seenslowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to4.2 pct in 1988, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The weakness of the West German economy is the biggestsingle factor, with import growth there expected to feature asluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast inDecember, the EIU said.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in WestGermany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, whileJapan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, morecompetitively-priced dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials andoil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to overthe current OECD average of three pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Non-oil commodity priceswill show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the firsttime since 1984, the EIU said.</sentence>
		<sentence>After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price ofinternationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.</sentence>

		<sentence>A free trade pact between the UnitedStates and Canada could spur the economies of both sidessubstantially, according to a study released by the Institutefor International Economics.</sentence>
		<sentence>The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusionto the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada'sgross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.export's by about seven pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue ofgovernment subsidies, end curbs on trade in services andinvestments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</sentence>
		<sentence>The United States and Canada - the world's two biggesttrading partners with cross border shipments of about 150billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June.</sentence>
		<sentence>Theyare aiming for a pact by next October.</sentence>
		<sentence>Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity ofMaryland, said an agreement should include:    - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phasedin over a five to 10-year period;    - Equal access to federal government procurement in the twocountries, replacing current "Buy America" and "Buy Canada"provisions with a "Buy North America" provision;    - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly financeand transportation;    - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favordomestic producers;    - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, thetwo sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.</sentence>
		<sentence>The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offsetsubsidies should go first a special disputes commission forresolution at an early stage.</sentence>
		<sentence>Wonnacott said "bilateral free trade would contribute to theefficiency of the North American economies and to theircompetitiveness in facing overseas producers.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadiangoods and enable them to benefit from the economies of massproduction.</sentence>
		<sentence>Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those toCanada proportionately, he said, because of the already largeU.S. gross national product.</sentence>

		<sentence>The Bank of England said it was takingonto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pctTreasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct onapplication.</sentence>
		<sentence>The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pctand will be available for dealings from March 11, with theremainder of the amount payable on May 5.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank said thebonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be freeof tax to residents overseas.</sentence>
		<sentence>The issue would be designated8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 "B."</sentence>
		<sentence>A further 100 mln stg wasreserved for the National Debt Commissioners.</sentence>
		<sentence>The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank'sannouncement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20minutes after the news.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against thebackdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rateswhich had built up over the past two weeks as a result ofsterling's strength.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared tosee lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoonannounced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a ratecut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delaya reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorableclimb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure andallow a half-point cut.</sentence>
		<sentence>Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the marketas a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further earlyrate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.</sentence>
		<sentence>Most market participants believe that Lawson will nowfoster a further half point interest rate reduction at the timeof the budget, although one or two said they would not besurprised to see a full point decline at this stage.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attemptslast week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issueda one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing theGovernment bond market.</sentence>
		<sentence>To the surprise of most participants, the issue was soldout within hours of becoming available for trading and themarket pushed on to register further sharp gains.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that theissue announced today would be absorbed by the market asrapidly as last week's.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, they noted that although sterling had edged downfrom its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closedon a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300GMT.</sentence>

		<sentence>President Reagan's denial that heknew proceeds from Iran arms sales were diverted to Nicaraguancontra rebels might be challenged by his former nationalsecurity adviser, according to the Washington Post.</sentence>
		<sentence>The paper said yesterday that John Poindexter, who resignedlast November when the illegal transfer of up to 20 mln dlrswas disclosed, was ready to break the silence he has so farmaintained over the affair.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Post said he might tell a special Senate committeeinvestigating the Iran scandal that he told Reagan twice in1986 that money from Iran sales was being used for aid to thecontras.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said the panel was considering granting Poindexterimmunity from prosecution over the fund diversion, which wasillegal under a Congressional ban in force at the time againstaid for the contras.</sentence>
		<sentence>Poindexter has so far invoked the Fifth Amendment to theConstitution which protects people from giving evidence whichcould be self-incriminating.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan has said he authorized the sale of arms to Iran inthe hope of establishing links with Iranian moderates, but hasdenied knowing that proceeds were ending up in Nicaraguan rebelhands.</sentence>
		<sentence>A White House spokesman had no comment on the Post story,but David Abshire, who is coordinating White House handling ofthe affair, said Reagan would never approve any illegal action.</sentence>

		<sentence>During its routine intervention in the market, the banktrimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses byhalf a point and National Westminster led the other clearingbanks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>The timing of the Bank of England move took operators bysurprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampenhopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.</sentence>
		<sentence>For some time, fundamentals haveled the market to push for a one point cut in base lendingrates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to followwholesale money market rates down.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although political considerations -- the government's wishto see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- hadbeen suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank'sdelaying action, worries about the real strength of sterlingand perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of theBudget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealerssaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut,leaving the market still looking for another half point fall.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consequently, rates in the money market eased during theday, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at10-5/16 3/16 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sterling cd's were similarly down between5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated ataround 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at theend of last week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Today, overnight touched a high of some11-3/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated300 mln stg shortage.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - S/P CUT HAS NO EFFECT</subject>
		<sentence>In an unusual move, Standard and Poor'sCorp downgraded a U.S. corporate debt issue soon after it waspriced for offering late last week.</sentence>
		<sentence>But, unlike a similar action in September 1986, whichinvestment bankers said disrupted the financing, the agency'srate reduction had no effect this time, traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>S and P announced Friday afternoon that it cut to B fromB-plus a 900 mln dlr issue of senior notes due 1994 of HolidayInns Inc, a unit of Holiday Corp <HIA>.</sentence>
		<sentence>The notes were pricedlate Thursday by sole manager Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a release, Standard and Poor's said the action reflecteda change in the note issue's terms to an unsecured form of debtfrom secured.</sentence>
		<sentence>That change was made after the agency rated thenotes on February 20, S and P stated.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We took action as we became aware that the issue'sstructure had changed," said Robert Nelson of S and P. "Wegenerally make a distinction between secured and unsecureddebt, and this was the key factor in our downgrade."</sentence>
		<sentence>A spokesman for Drexel said the action did not affect theHoliday Inns deal, which had already sold out to investors bylate Friday afternoon.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Holiday notes are trading at 100.50 on a when-issuedbasis," the Drexel spokesman said soon after S and P'sannouncement.</sentence>
		<sentence>The 10-1/2 pct notes had been priced at par.</sentence>
		<sentence>That is a far cry from late September, when S and Pdowngraded a 215 mln dlr issue of subordinated sinking funddebentures due 1998 of New World Pictures Ltd <NWP> just hoursafter the pricing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Because of the rating cut to CCC-plus fromB-minus, the underwriter halted sales and repriced the issue.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sole manager L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin initiallygave the debentures a 12-1/4 pct coupon and par pricing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Itthen repriced the issue at 97 to yield 12.74 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>New World Pictures had increased the issue to 215 mln dlrsfrom an original offering of 150 mln dlrs, and that brought inS and P. The agency cited the larger financing in its actionand said it believed the issuer's cash from existing operationswould not be enough to adequately service debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>An officer with S and P said at the time the rating agencywas not told beforehand that the issue had been increased insize.</sentence>
		<sentence>Usually, issuers and underwriters alert the ratingagencies to any changes in debt offerings, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In both cases, Moody's Investors Service Inc declined tofollow suit, bond traders noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>Indeed, Moody's announced Friday that its original ratingof B-1 for the Holiday Inns notes remained appropriate.</sentence>
		<sentence>Moody's pointed out that while the seven-year notes wouldbe unsecured obligations of Holiday Inns, the issue wouldbenefit from a negative pledge provision and a call forspecified collateral under certain circumstances.</sentence>
		<sentence>The agency also said the B-1 rating continued to recognizea highly leveraged debt structure that would result fromHoliday's recapitalization program, as well as the company'sdependence on property sales to produce adequate cash flow fornear-term debt service.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Aside from Holiday Inns and New World Pictures, I cannotremember the last time an issue was downgraded so soon afterthe pricing," remarked one corporate bond trader.</sentence>
		<sentence>Holiday Inns also sold Thursday via Drexel 500 mln dlrs ofsubordinated debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and parpricing.</sentence>
		<sentence>The debentures' ratings of B-2 by Moody's and B-minusby S and P were left unchanged on Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence>The combined offering of 1.4 billion dlrs was thesecond-largest junk bond deal ever brought to market,underwriters and traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said the biggest was BCIHoldings' 2.35 billion dlr offering on April 10, 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>That the Holiday Inns deal sold out quickly underscored theappetite of many investors for high-yield securities.</sentence>
		<sentence>"People are hungry for yield.</sentence>
		<sentence>They are not worried aboutdownside risk at all, especially for junk bonds issued bywell-known companies," said one portfolio manager.</sentence>
		<sentence>As a result, investors are expected to snap up this week'splanned offerings by Allied Stores Corp of 200 mln dlrs ofsenior notes due 1992, rated B-2/B, and 600 mln dlrs of seniorsubordinated debentures due 1997, rated B-3/CCC-plus.</sentence>

		<subject>GERMAN BANKS SAY COMPANY HOLDINGS FALLING</subject>
		<sentence>West German private banks, in thelatest twist in a long-running battle over the size of theirholdings in industry, have said the holdings were falling andrejected calls for tighter limits on these participations.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under West Germany's banking system, banks can hold sharesin non-banking companies giving them seats on companysupervisory boards, and administer the holdings of smallshareholders in safe custody accounts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Holdings of over 25 pct, which give a veto right in thesupervisory board of a company, must be disclosed.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The claim that the concentration of power has intensified,as made by the Monopolies Commission, therefore turns out notto be accurate ...</sentence>
		<sentence>There is no reason to impose further legalrestrictions on the acquisition of holdings by banks," it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Association's letter is the latest skirmish in a longrunning battle between banks on the one hand and a range ofgovernment offices and political lobbies on the left and right.</sentence>
		<sentence>The number of holdings above 10 pct in public companieswith a nominal share capital of over one mln marks held bythese 10 banks fell to 86 in 1986 from 129 in 1976, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Of these 43 reductions, 41 represented holdings of over 25pct in 1976.</sentence>
		<sentence>The banks' holdings of nominal share capital fellto 1.70 billion marks in 1986, or 1.34 billion adjusted forcapital changes in the past 10 years from 1.80 billion in 1976.</sentence>
		<sentence>Over this period total West German nominal share capitalrose to 235 billion marks from 136 billion, so that the holdingof banks in German companies fell to 0.7 pct from 1.3 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>The nominal share capital of listed non-bank companies roseto an estimated 49 billion marks in 1986 from 35.58 billion in1976, with banks' holdings falling to 1.57 billion marks or 3.2pct from 1.61 billion marks or 4.5 pct, the Association said.</sentence>
		<sentence>It argued that bank representatives were in a minority onthe supervisory boards of the 100 biggest German companies, andin most cases could be blocked by non-banking representatives.</sentence>
		<sentence>The survey covered Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F>, Dresdner BankAG <DRSD.F>, Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F>, Bayerische Vereinsbank AG<BVMG.F> and Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank AG<BHWG.F>.</sentence>
		<sentence>It also covered Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank<BHFG.F>, <Berliner Bank AG>, <Industriekreditbank AG>,Vereins- und Westbank AG <VHBG.F> and <Baden-WuerttembergischeBank AG>.</sentence>
		<sentence>Deutsche holds by far the largest number of such stakes,including 28.5 pct of Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F>.</sentence>
		<sentence>Criticism of the bank holdings has not only come from theMonopolies Commission and left-wing parties.</sentence>
		<sentence>An advisorycommission, in a report late last year to the EconomicsMinistry, urged implementation of the five pct proposed by theMonopolies Commission to promote competition and avoid interestconflicts.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Economics Ministry has been controlled by the liberalFree Democrat Party, junior partner in the centre-rightcoalition government and increasingly in favour ofderegulation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Furthermore the West German Supreme Court recentlysupported an action by a private Deutsche shareholder demandingmore transparency in the bank's balance sheet.</sentence>
		<sentence>The shareholder argued that the bank's ability to declareindustrial stakes of more than 25 pct as only temporaryholdings evaded the statutory requirement to report them infull.</sentence>
		<sentence>If a bank declares stakes temporary it does not have todisclose them but can include them under securities holdings.</sentence>

		<sentence>The World Bank intends to bringborrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because itexpects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bankvice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan,West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The weightof opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higherprobability there will be one pct higher than one pct lowerinterest rates," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so farthis year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at alevel that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where andhow much to borrow, Rotberg said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years'anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstandingdebt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, itdid not intend to launch new financial instruments just for thesake of innovation, Rotberg said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only someeight billion had been swapped into another currency.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors orunfair to borrowers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Until the World Bank was confident thatthis was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.</sentence>
		<sentence>The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed overthe next year with methods used before, Rotberg said.</sentence>
		<sentence>However,for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out newinstruments such as bonds with warrants.</sentence>

		<sentence>USX Corp chairman David Roderick calledfor a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currenciesto help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit, whichlast year reached 170 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Clubof Detroit, Roderick said, "There should be total resolve thatthe dollar versus other major currencies, as well as thecurrencies of other nations having a substantial trade surpluswith us, must continue to decline so that the correction in ourtrade deficit starts on the road to recovery."</sentence>
		<sentence>Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the"economic pain" our trading partners experience as a result ofa falling dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>But, he added, "As painful as the correction may be to ourtrading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problemuncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable,lengthy and steep world recession."</sentence>
		<sentence>Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 thedollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against majorindustrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broadergroup of currencies of nearly all developing nations.</sentence>
		<sentence>At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets inthe U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had asurplus in assets of 141 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>A company spokesman said thedata were provided by economic consultants to USX.</sentence>
		<sentence>The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pctrise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although otherfactors were involved, Roderick said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But it is wrong, he said,"to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmentaldeterioration of U.S. productivity or of American productquality."</sentence>
		<sentence>These areas need to be improved but they are not the rootcause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He urgedAmerican manufacturers to become more competitive so they cancompete in global markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes insecurities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporateraiders and speculators.</sentence>
		<sentence>Among his proposals, which he presented to the SenateBanking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirementthat raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stockthey acquire in a company.</sentence>
		<sentence>Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for allcash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders berequired to have financing in place before a tender is made.</sentence>
		<sentence>Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cashtender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company'sstock, he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>"If there have been talks, they were casual at best," saida source at the company.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There is nothing going on that wouldlead to immediate or near-term collaboration" on a new plane.</sentence>
		<sentence>Senior officials at the aerospace firm's St. Louisheadquarters were unable to comment more specifically onweekend published reports from Europe that talks about a jointventure have resumed after they broke off last fall.</sentence>
		<sentence>McDonnell Douglas and Airbus last spring and summer haddiscussed jointly developing and building a long-range aircraftto compete with Boeing Co <BA> 747 wide-body jetliner, or itssuccessor.</sentence>
		<sentence>Talks ended when neither side wanted to forego plansto launch its own widebody jetliner projects - McDonnellDouglas with its MD-11 and Airbus with its A340.</sentence>
		<sentence>McDonnell Douglas has since launched the MD-11 jetliner, asuccessor to its DC-10, and has more than 100 orders andoptions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Airbus wants to launch its program this spring and is nowseeking customers for the long-range A340 and a companionplane, the shorter-range A330.</sentence>

		<sentence>McDonnell Douglas last month claimed Airbus tried tooverturn pledges made by airlines to buy the MD-11 by offeringcut-rate prices for the A340.</sentence>
		<sentence>The firm said Airbus, in an effort to line up enoughcustomers to launch the program, is engaging in "predatorypractices" with prices substantially below those needed torecover the cost of developing and building the plane.</sentence>

		<sentence>A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at anumber of options to identify the most cost effective andefficient way to proceed, including one which would involvemoving the entire grains floor out of the building and into thenearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.</sentence>
		<sentence>"One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items hasbeen to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,"the spokesman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another CBT official, executive vice president GeorgeSladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at aspecial meeting on the exchange floor.</sentence>
		<sentence>A number of presentations have been made with regard torenovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We'velooked at five or six different alternatives, involving suchthings as flip-flopping the trading rooms," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, wemight use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBTmarkets, Sladoje said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If we move out of one floor entirely, then theconstruction period will be about a year," he said, adding thatthe issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and thenbe on the drawing board for eight months to a year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were verypreliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin untilthis summer at the earliest.</sentence>
		<sentence>In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits,exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporaryhome next door in the present grains-dominated area.</sentence>
		<sentence>This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bondfutures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds andT-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing theMidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat,soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options.</sentence>
		<sentence>Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBTmembers.</sentence>
		<sentence>One senior floor trader said the financial futures roombadly needs renovating.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm andthe financials will move to the grains area," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed wasto renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at atime.</sentence>

		<sentence>Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition ofAmerican Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs,including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs inAmerican Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.</sentence>
		<sentence>The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefingChrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company'sagreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mlndlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is notincluded valuing the transaction.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposedpurchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected thetransaction would carry with it a short-term dilution inChrysler's earnings.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, toldReuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than itwould have been had a deal been struck last year because theimpact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability toassume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwardsaccumulated from its losses since 1980.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There were very serious discussions last fall but wedidn't pull it off," the source said in a reference to theassassination in November of former Renault chairman GeorgesBesse.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.</sentence>
		<sentence>And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd doneit before the end of last year."</sentence>
		<sentence>In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, thesource said Chrysler would also assume any liability fromlawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called "an overhangto the company."</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them thatthe deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principalin the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mlndlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25mln dlrs in cash for "transaction fees" in connection with theacquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paidAMC shareholders.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,"analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC'sliabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMCdebt that is being carried at "non-market" rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said there were difficulties in negotiating with theprevious Renault management on the acquisition because theywere committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was anintegral part.</sentence>

		<sentence>The Philippines' bank advisorycommittee meets tomorrow to discuss its response to a novelproposal by finance minister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of thecountry's interest bill with investment notes instead of cash,bankers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ongpin outlined his plan today to the 12-bank advisorycommittee headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.    Bankers declined to comment on today's meeting but said thepanel's response could be crucial to the fate of the talks,which are now in their second week.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The ball's in our courtnow," one banker on the committee said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under Ongpin's rescheduling plan, the Philippines wouldoffer to make interest payments in cash at 5/8 pct over theLondon Interbank Offered Rate.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banks which found this rate unacceptably low would beoffered an alternative of LIBOR payments in cash plus a marginof one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes, PINs,bankers explained.</sentence>
		<sentence>These tradable, dollar-denominated zero-coupon notes wouldhave a maturity of six years, but they would be redeemable atany time at par for pesos to fund investments approved as partof the government's debt-equity scheme.</sentence>
		<sentence>Because banks would be able to sell the PINs tomultinational investors at relatively small discounts to facevalue, their total yield would be boosted well above the 5/8pct cash margin, according to the Philippine proposal.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although bankers are eager to foster foreign investment inthe Philippines, the PINs idea is likely to run into stiffresistance by at least some members of the bank advisorycommittee because it would establish the precedent of someinterest payments being made with paper rather than cash.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ongpin has said that U.S. regulators and accountants hadgiven a green light to his idea, but bankers are not so sure.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. bankers fear that they would not be able to accountfor the notes in the same way as accruing cash interestpayments and that their profits would suffer accordingly.</sentence>
		<sentence>If the banks reject the proposal out of hand, however, theyrun the risk of scuttling the talks, for Ongpin has insistedthat he would not accept a margin above 5/8 pct.</sentence>

		<subject>FUTURE OF EC BUTTER DISPOSAL SCHEME IN DOUBT</subject>
		<sentence>A 3.6 billion dlr plan to rid theEuropean Community (EC) of one mln tonnes of surplus butter isin doubt as Spain and Portugal refuse to drop their oppositionto the scheme, diplomats said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The plan, proposed by the Community's executive Commission,aims to level most of the EC's huge and costly butter mountainby disposing of a total of 1.04 mln tonnes this year and next.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the officials said Spain and Portugal, which joined the12-nation bloc at the beginning of last year, continued tooppose the scheme at a meeting of EC finance ministers here.</sentence>
		<sentence>They argued they should not have to pay for the disposal ofsurpluses created before they became EC members.</sentence>
		<sentence>The plan, already approved by farm ministers despiteopposition from Madrid and Lisbon, had been sent to financeministers for final approval.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the diplomats said the finance ministers insteadreferred it back to the Commission, asking it to study possibleways to solve the row as soon as possible.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said Spain and Portugal indicated they may go to theEuropean Court of Justice over the issue if the Commission didnot come up with a satisfactory solution.</sentence>
		<sentence>The scheme has also run into criticism from the EC'sfinancial watchdog, the Court of Auditors.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Court has said the plan is unsound because theCommission wants member states to foot the bill until it startsreimbursing them in four annual instalments from 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence>Diplomats said Spain and Portugal backed the court's viewand also complained that, under complex financial agreementsworked out when they joined the EC, they would get less backlater than if they were reimbursed now.</sentence>
		<sentence>Commission sources said it appeared the two countries wereholding out in a bid to squeeze some form of compensation outof their partners but it was unclear how much longer they wouldcontinue to block the scheme.</sentence>

		<sentence>A confidential World Bank report on thePeruvian economy has said the government's strategy does notoffer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and islikely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure.</sentence>
		<sentence>The report, published today by the economic monthly, ThePeru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia'sgovernment in stimulating output last year to achieve a growthin gross domestic product of over eight pct "represents gains inthe short term at the expense of the long."</sentence>
		<sentence>Government officials had no immediate comment on thereport, which advised a reduction in the overall size of thepublic investment program and greater emphasis on thepreservation of Peru's export potential.</sentence>
		<sentence>The report said that although the government had succeededin cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivationprogram was encountering rising difficulties.</sentence>
		<sentence>"An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked tomonetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing ofprice controls, appears not improbable," it added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The world bank report said the government's policies hadreduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption atthe apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of thecurrency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses,and sharply diminished creditworthiness.</sentence>

		<sentence>This operation was coordinated with the Japanesemonetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and theU.S. Treasury.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Fed's intervention was on the morning after presidentReagan's State of the Union message and was "in a mannerconsistent with the joint statement" made by U.S. Treasurysecretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister KiichiMiyazawa after their January 21 consultations.</sentence>
		<sentence>At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness tocooperate on exchange rate issues.</sentence>

		<sentence>The Arbitration Commission awardedthe Australian workforce a flat 10 dlrs a week wage increaseand allowed trade unions to begin bargaining for a second-tierincrease of up to four pct, Commission President Justice BarryMaddern said here.</sentence>
		<sentence>The decision is effective from the next pay period ofindividual employers, he said in delivering the Commission'sNational Wage Case decision.</sentence>
		<sentence>Full-time adult ordinary time weekly earnings are 453.00dlrs a week for males and 428.40 dlrs for all adults, accordingto latest official statistics.</sentence>
		<sentence>The wage decision is the first under the previouslyannounced two-tier system which replaced the concept of wageindexation.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is the first national wage rise since apartially-indexed increase of 2.3 pct was awarded by theCommission last July.</sentence>
		<sentence>The decision is a compromise between the Federalgovernment's call at the Wage Case hearing for a 10 dlr weeklyrise plus a three pct second-tier ceiling and the AustralianCouncil of Trade Unions' (ACTU) claim of 20 dlrs and up to fourpct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Employer groups had sought no rise at all.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Commission is willing to convene another Wage Case inOctober to establish if another wage increase of up to 1.5 pctshould be awarded, Maddern said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the success of the new system depended on thecommitment of all parties - employers, unions and governments.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the Commission had rejected employers' calls for afreeze on overall labour cost increases.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We do not think that such an outcome is feasible, given theneeds and expectations of wage and salary earners,' he said,adding a freeze could have destroyed the possibility of acooperative effort to lift Australia's economic performance.</sentence>
		<sentence>The decision would ensure the effects of the depreciationof the Australian dollar and the adverse terms of trade wouldnot be reflected in wage increases, Maddern said.</sentence>
		<sentence>If necessary, it would arbitrate second-tier claims at animplementation rate of no more than two pct from September thisyear and a further two pct from July 1988, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said labour cost rises would be phased in over the lifeof the package, adding that second-tier rises will be mainlyachieved by a restructuring and efficiency principle, coveringelimination of restrictive work practices, improved efficiencyand productivity and reduction of demarcation disputes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Maddern said the Commission again ruled out claims for acut in weekly working hours below 38 and allowed employers tobe exempted from wage case decisions on the basis of severe orextreme economic adversity.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Commission said the poor economic outlook noted in itslast decision had persisted, and was perhaps now more serious.</sentence>

		<sentence>Statistics Department figures show total debt fell to 32.94billion N.Z.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dlrs in the December quarter from 33.42 billion inSeptember, although the government's share rose to 21.32billion from 20.75 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>Douglas said in a statement this was due to the boosting ofreserves to refinance so-called "Think Big" projects.</sentence>
		<sentence>"These reserves do not add to New Zealand's totalindebtedness....</sentence>
		<sentence>They are money in the bank," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"As negotiations to refinance each Think Big project arecompleted, existing loans will be replaced with debt currentlyheld in reserves for this purpose," Douglas added.</sentence>
		<sentence>This in turn will result in a drop in quasi-government andprivate debt, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said refinancing of projects allowed the government toborrow on more favourable terms and to manage Think Big debtsmore effectively.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Both of these will reduce the cost of Think Big to thetaxpayer over time," he said.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS</subject>
		<sentence>Japanese microchip makers are beingstrong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact onsemiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan'smarket to foreign chips, industry analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But doubts remain over whether the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuringthe firms, can successfully battle market forces and whetherthe U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of anybreathing space, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Threats to scrap the agreement signed last Septemberhave pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanesechipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industryto get things done," said Bache Securities (Japan) associatevice president Peter Wolffe.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for theJanuary to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensivechips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subjectto the pact's price controls.</sentence>
		<sentence>The ministry also asked electronics firms to providedistributors with certificates designating them as authorisedexporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which greymarketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was injeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American marketsand little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.</sentence>
		<sentence>But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to theproduction cuts, several analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last week, NEC Corpsaid it would cut production in line with MITI's request.</sentence>
		<sentence>"NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI'sdemands," said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. "OnceNEC cuts production, it means they all have."</sentence>
		<sentence>Still, pressures remain to keep production high.</sentence>
		<sentence>Japanesefirms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sales thatthe Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The best way to lower cost is to produce more," said SalomonBrothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.</sentence>
		<sentence>Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could alsospur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst MattAizawa said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any newrestrictions, some industry officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's like tax avoidance schemes," said Steve Donovan, headof MMI Japan K.K.</sentence>
		<sentence>"As soon as you close one route, anotheropens."</sentence>
		<sentence>MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earliershrugged off MITI guidance.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's getting to be like communism," said one.</sentence>
		<sentence>But analysts said output cuts could help by making iteasier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcingfirms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They're going to have to start running their businesseslike businesses," Bache's Wolffe said.</sentence>
		<sentence>MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaignurging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industryofficials said response has been mixed at best.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There has been some change, but it's not across the board,"said one U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Spokesman.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The companies have a varying degree ofurgency."</sentence>
		<sentence>The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on thetroubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamicrandom access memory) chips could merely speed the transitionto one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memorychips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, theysaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing themost advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.</sentence>

		<sentence>The striking price was a partly paid41 stg pct, at which price bids were allotted 53.8 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers noted that strong demand had been detected for thebonds yesterday afternoon and interest was further stimulatedby sterling's surge at the opening this morning.</sentence>
		<sentence>The issue was announced on Monday, when it was widely seenas a move by the authorities to brake market optimism for afurther U.K. Interest rate reduction following the half-pointcut in clearing bank base lending rates to 10.5 pct earlier inthe day.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP</subject>
		<sentence>China's foreign debt reached 27 billiondlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure toshort-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains verycreditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreignbankers and Chinese officials told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply froman estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increasedimport commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low,between eight and 10 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relationsand Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loanagreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs inthe 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers saidthey estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too muchshort-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as aresult of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractivelow interest rates in the Japanese market.</sentence>
		<sentence>The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and islikely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of thecountry's total debt at about 30 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Peking representative of a Japanese securities housesaid the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China,which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to goelsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread," hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans isin part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capitalmarkets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Officials do not think of China but of their own departmentor firm.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some loans that were entered into did not have thefull backing of the People's Republic of China," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in otherareas, is to balance central control with giving reasonableautonomy to firms.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is searching for the mechanisms toexercise indirect controls," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over thepast six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not beaffected by a drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrasemeaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal ofCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.</sentence>
		<sentence>A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China'sforeign exchange reserves have fallen below the officiallystated figure of 10 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in themarket, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily inadvance of an announcement the reserves were down," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The banker said such buying has not been going on.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Thingsare normal.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade deficits such as China had last year and in1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development."</sentence>
		<sentence>Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade officialsaid this year's outlook for exports, which account for morethan 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthierthan a year ago.</sentence>
		<sentence>The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Itwas quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official said China has taken measures to improve itsexport performance, including incentive offers to exporters andthe establishment of export production bases.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year," headded.</sentence>
		<sentence>Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from thedrop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs carefulmanagement but its debt service ratio remains very low at sixto eight pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchangereserves but on its export performance, just as you assess acompany on its performance, not its bank account," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said China performed very well in the export field lastyear and remains a very creditworthy country which will havefew difficulties in increasing its borrowing.</sentence>

		<sentence>Preussag hasfrequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986following a difficult year in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said inDecember the board would prefer to stick to its policy of notdipping into reserves to pay dividends.</sentence>
		<sentence>The spokesman noted thefinal dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 comparedwith 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil andshipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends inthe group's other divisions.</sentence>
		<sentence>The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domesticgroup would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would dependpartly on the level of provisions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from ninemarks on 1984 results after parent company net profit droppedto 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.</sentence>

		<sentence>Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.</sentence>
		<sentence>The statement said its results in 1986 were affected byunsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as bypoor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.</sentence>
		<sentence>The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarterof 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was anadditional factor behind the drop in results.</sentence>
		<sentence>Preussag said rationalization measures already introducedwould not begin to take full effect until this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billionmarks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the firsttime consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from itsmajority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.</sentence>
		<sentence>Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alonewas 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparisonfigures.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN</subject>
		<sentence>The U.S. is urging reluctantcommercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novelPhilippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believesthe innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debtstrategy, a Reagan administration official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleasfor interest rate concessions should be treated much moreseriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developingnations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.</sentence>
		<sentence>In addition, he signaled that the banks might want toreconsider the idea of a "megabank," where Third World debt wouldbe pooled, and suggested the administration would support sucha plan, even though it was not formally proposing it.</sentence>
		<sentence>At thesame time, however, the official expressed reservations thatsuch a scheme would ever get off the ground.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Philippine proposal, together with Argentinesuggestions that "exit bonds" be issued to end the troublesomerole of small banks in the debt strategy, would help tounderpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,the official said in an interview with Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>"All of these things would fit within the definition of ourinitiative as we have asked it and we think any novel andunique approach such as those should be considered," said theofficial, who asked not to be named.</sentence>
		<sentence>In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategyunder which commercial banks and multilateral institutions suchas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.</sentence>
		<sentence>In return, America called on the debtor countries to enacteconomic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtorshave been performing well," said the official.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he admittedthat the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly anexception.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S.Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker,also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improvetheir role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We called at the very beginning for the bank syndicationsto find procedures or processes whereby they could operate moreeffectively," the official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions thatcommercial banks create a "megabank" which could swap Third Worlddebt paper for so-called "exit bonds" for banks like regionalAmerican or European institutions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need tolend money to their former debtors every time a new moneypackage was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina inits current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>He emphasised that the "megabank" was not an administrationplan but "something some people have suggested."</sentence>
		<sentence>Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks areexamining the creation of a consortium bank to assume ThirdWorld debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>This plan, actively under consideration, woulddiffer slightly from the one the official described.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a planwould work in the United States.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,fine.</sentence>
		<sentence>I don't think they ever will."</sentence>
		<sentence>He pointed out that banks would swap their Third Worldloans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctantto provide new money to debtors through the new institution.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan underwhich it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at nomore than 5/8 pct above Libor.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quiteunique and I don't think it's something that should becategorically rejected out of hand," the official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banks which found this level unacceptably low would beoffered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a marginabove that of one pct in the form of Philippine InvestmentNotes.</sentence>
		<sentence>These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have asix-year life and if banks swapped them for cash beforematurity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 pointover Libor.</sentence>
		<sentence>Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far toolow.</sentence>
		<sentence>The talks, now in their second week, are aimed atstretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt andgranting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduleddebt.</sentence>
		<sentence>The country, which has enjoyed strong political supportin Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early lastyear, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the official denied the plan amounts to interest ratecapitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to thebanks.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if youhave a write down in the spread over Libor from what existedbefore," the official said in comments suggesting some ought tobe granted the rate concessions they seek.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Some people arguethat (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it reallyis is narrowing the spread on new money," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as aninitiative to include plans like the Philippines'.</sentence>

		<subject>POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION</subject>
		<sentence>Interest in the currency futures markethas shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentiallyexplosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continentaland Japanese currencies, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the pastweek-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to thedollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...andtechnically, the pound is in the best shape," PaineWebberanalyst Jason Gillard said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, andwe're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,"Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many traders took on long pound/short West German markfutures positions, although some of those cross-trades wereliquidated yesterday, Sloane said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have beenrelatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimismsurrounding the British economy, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Money seems to be chasing yields," William Byers, of BearStearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in thepound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek torelieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing downinterest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17.</sentence>
		<sentence>The budget itself could have an impact, depending on howwell it is received, but analysts say relative interest ratesand oil income remain the main influences on the currency.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K.interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cuttheir discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloanesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, butSloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sideways price pattern in the June contract, withsmaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a "bull flag" onprice charts, technically-oriented analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It makes for an explosive type of situation that oftenleads to a breakout," in this case to the upside, Sloane said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadiandollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recentclose at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>"At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-termpositive, but for the technical burden of proof you need aclose above (the previous contract high of) 75.25," Byers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>As to the traditionally more active currencies, stabilitywas the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs andJune German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400,respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430.</sentence>
		<sentence>Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still veryrespectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bankintervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We may still probe to see what the parameters are," Byerssaid, "but people are very reluctant because they don't knowwhere the central banks will be (to intervene)."</sentence>
		<sentence>Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous priceconsolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundlysluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer atthat level.</sentence>

		<subject>VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS</subject>
		<sentence>Lower production of coconutand palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocksthis year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseedsanalyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at AlbertaAgriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the worldvegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Prices for edible oils appear to have more upsidepotential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedenteddecline in the production of tree oils," Balletto said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palmkernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mlntonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.</sentence>
		<sentence>He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearanceat 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.</sentence>
		<sentence>Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said,disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting thecrush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing inthe edible oils sector could develop," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This would be relatively favorable for the prices of highoil yielding seeds," Balletto said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed pricesbecause of burdensome supplies, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increasefor the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes,compared with 25.4 mln last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The increase should result from lower disappearance, asproduction is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7mln last year, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mlntonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said,while production of other oilseeds was lower.</sentence>
		<sentence>Higher soybean production in South America and Europe madeup for lower production in the United States, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S.stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes,about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased13.1 mln tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>"During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire worldsurplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificiallyhigh prices caused by the U.S. loan program."</sentence>
		<sentence>"Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseedsprices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as longas the U.S. soybean surplus continues.</sentence>
		<sentence>For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in arange tied to the U.S. loan program.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supplyoverhang while strong underlying support is provided by theU.S. loan rate."</sentence>
		<sentence>The problem is likely to become worse as the artificiallyhigh prices encourage producers in South America, Canada andAustralia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.</sentence>

		<sentence>The borrowing limit of the Hong KongExchange Fund, set up to regulate the value of the Hong Kongdollar, has been raised to 50 billion H.K.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dlrs from 30 billionby the legislature, an official statement said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The limit governs total borrowing by the fund from thegovernment's general revenue account and various funds as wellas borrowing by the fund arising from money market operations.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bulk of the government's fiscal surplus is invested bythe Treasury with the exchange fund against the issue by thefund of interest-bearing debt certificates, Financial SecretaryPiers Jacobs said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"At the close of the business today, the total amount ofdebt certificates issued by the Exchange Fund in return formoney transferred from the general revenue account and thevarious funds, in other words the total borrowing by theExchange Fund from these sources, will be 26.9 billion dlrs,"Jacobs said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said borrowing arising from money market operationswould amount to an additional 2.9 billion dlrs, making a totalof 29.8 billion dlrs, just short of the borrowing limit of 30billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jacobs said the government's fiscal reserves are expectedto total 32 billion dlrs by the end of the current fiscal yearending March 31.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The current borrowing limit of 30 billion dlrs will,therefore, constrain the ability of the Exchange Fund tocontinue to take in these fiscal reserves by the issue ofinterest-bearing debt certificates," he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>The Reagan administration is totallyopposed to recent Democratic suggestions that securitiestransactions should be taxed to help curb the budget deficit,an administration official said in an interview.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We're totally opposed to a securities transfers tax.</sentence>
		<sentence>Itwould impair the efficiency of some of the most efficientmarkets in the world," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He declined to be named.</sentence>
		<sentence>In recent days House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat,has called for such a tax to raise the 20 billion dlrs heestimates is needed to meet legal deficit reduction targets.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It would fall primarily in my view not on wealthyindividuals but on middle income people who occasionally investand trade.</sentence>
		<sentence>So I think it's a very bad idea," said the official,who is an administration economic policy-maker.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official also rejected a suggestion by Wright that theadministration delay next year's cut in top tax rates, calledfor in the recently-passed overhaul of the U.S. Tax system.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It is breaking faith with the American people ...</sentence>
		<sentence>It wouldbe a real breach of faith," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Gramm-Rudman Hollings law calls for a balanced budgetby 1991, but its power has been reduced in the Supreme Court.</sentence>
		<sentence>Wright and other Democrats say even if they pass PresidentReagan's budget proposals for the fiscal year starting thisOctober, they would miss by some 20 billion dlrs the 108billion dlr target for the budget deficit set under theGramm-Rudman law.</sentence>
		<sentence>The administration puts the deficit at 173.2 billion dlrsin the current fiscal year and claims that spending cuts andrevenue increases will achieve the Gramm-Rudman goal.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official, who is knowlegeable on budget strategy, alsosaid President Reagan was still opposed to a so-called 'budgetsummit' with Congress to resolve the deficit issue.</sentence>
		<sentence>The suggestion of a 'budget summit' emerged again recentlyafter Democrats and Republicans alike said Reagan needed adeficit reduction package and an arms control accord withMoscow to rebuild his presidency after the Iran arms scandal.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the official dismissed the budget summit idea as anattempt by the Democrats to secure a tax increase.</sentence>
		<sentence>He accusedthem of being overly critical before they had written their ownbudget proposal, due out on April 1.</sentence>

		<sentence>The bill, which goes to the full Senate, will infuse abadly needed 7.5 billion dlrs into the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., which insures accounts of depositors.</sentence>

		<sentence>Committee Chairman William Proxmire, the bill's sponsor,promised the committee will work on a long-term plan for newdevelopments in the financial services industry, which isconfronted by growing competition from firms in othercommercial centers, such as London and Tokyo.</sentence>

		<sentence>The oil services industry is on theverge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oilindustry analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on somestocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in thesecond half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in thefirst half, and continue into the next decade.</sentence>
		<sentence>"People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to goup to start buying," said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior researchanalyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.</sentence>

		<subject>OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING</subject>
		<sentence>OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment tofixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and anoverall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) todefend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He told a news conference here "After due consultation withmy colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeriaand all member countries of OPEC remain determined to upholdthe December agreement by adhering strictly to their variousquotas and official selling prices."</sentence>
		<sentence>Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleadingnews in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC membercountries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in themonth of February," Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firmdetermination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrsagreed upon last December in Geneva.</sentence>
		<sentence>The December agreement set an overall output ceiling forOPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixedprices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord butfell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing morethan the agreed level.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would nothold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases ofOPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs," Lukmansaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was basedon the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, addingthat Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000bpd.</sentence>
		<sentence>Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,while the production figures of Ecuador and the United ArabEmirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreementsucceed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price levelof 18 dlrs," the group's president said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the OPEC price differentials committee meetingformerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference isat the moment contemplated since most agreements reached inDecember are being adhered to," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrowthe gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed inrelation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied "We considerthe defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials."</sentence>
		<sentence>Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawnon stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels wellbelow this time last year and soon they would return to themarket in search of crude.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty inmaintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,"Lukman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which hesaid had contributed to the group's efforts to stabiliseprices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-heldview not to do anything to help the market.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term withtwo-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future isours.</sentence>
		<sentence>We will use that advantage responsibly," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's outputfollowing an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if theSouth American country would be allowed a higher output quotawhen it recovered from the disaster.</sentence>

		<sentence>National Bank of Hungary firstvice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pctdevaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress lastyear's severe trade deficit with the West.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve atleast equilibrium on its hard currency trade.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It is useful to have a devaluation," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There is now areal push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports."</sentence>
		<sentence>The official news agency MTI said today Hungary woulddevalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to beannounced later today.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fekete said the rates would come intoeffect tomorrow.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary hada higher rate of inflation over the past two years than itsmain partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and5.5 pct in 1986).</sentence>
		<sentence>This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took toprevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks ofthe 1970s, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and bybetween three and four pct early last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the country's hard currency trade balance neverthelessfell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency tradesurplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that amore likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on totalhard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>One Western commercial attache here said: "Devaluation ofitself will not change anything.</sentence>
		<sentence>It will only be useful if theyalso make efforts to restructure industry and improve thequality of their export goods."</sentence>
		<sentence>Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms thisyear to invest in restructuring industry.</sentence>
		<sentence>It would be his role to persuade international banks tocooperate in this process.</sentence>
		<sentence>He noted Hungary had been given anAA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samuraibond market.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billiondlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of acurrent account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly becausethe fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debtdenominated in marks or yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly thisyear, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose ofmodernisation.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I am for credits to invest for that purpose," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I amagainst credits for consumption."</sentence>
		<sentence>He forecast gross domesticproduct growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debtprofile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium termloans with cheaper long term money for which it was lookingmore and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where heconsidered rates to be low.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay ataround 3.5 billion dlrs, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the budget deficit, whichtripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year afterquadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry wasworking out measures to reduce an approved target deficit forthis year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billionforints.</sentence>

		<sentence>Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid totakeover American Motors Corp <AMO> should help bolster thesmall automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000employees in doubt, industry analysts say.</sentence>
		<sentence>It was "business as usual" yesterday at the American Motorsheadquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled byChrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to companyspokesman Edd Snyder.</sentence>
		<sentence>But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than ifit had continued with the state-run French car group as itscontrolling shareholder.</sentence>
		<sentence>Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assemblyplant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant wouldbe in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North Americanauto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass.</sentence>
		<sentence>Both plants are far from "state of the art" for carmanufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor laborrelations at each.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants," said MichaelLuckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm ShearsonLehman Brothers.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They probably will close the Toledo plant andmove Jeep production to Canada."</sentence>
		<sentence>Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at thevery least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able towring concessions from the United Automobile Workers unionlocal representing Jeep workers.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as theyhave AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will haveunderutilized facilities to transfer production," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said they foresaw no major complications thatwould abort a combination which historians said would be theauto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formedin 1954.</sentence>
		<sentence>AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its lossesof more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in Francefor Renault to cut its backing.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company had said it couldnot forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at theearliest.</sentence>
		<sentence>In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman LeeIacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mlndlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of1,200 dealers as the major attractions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventuallyto sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overheadcosts in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incurin the AMC buyout.</sentence>

		<subject>NAKASONE SET TO STAY UNTIL TAX REFORM APPROVED</subject>
		<sentence>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone willstep down only after his plan to overhaul Japan's tax systemgets parliamentary approval, one of his closest aides saidtoday.</sentence>
		<sentence>The aide, who declined to be identified, said at a privatemeeting, "Nakasone's power in office does not necessarilyterminate at the end of his term in October.</sentence>
		<sentence>It depends on when(the) seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval."</sentence>
		<sentence>Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despiteSunday's unexpected Upper House by-election defeat of theruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a conservativestronghold.</sentence>
		<sentence>The socialist winner, backed by other opposition parties,had campaigned against a controversial five pct value addedsales tax, the main plank of the reform plans.</sentence>
		<sentence>The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of thesales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demandingnothing but retraction of the tax.</sentence>
		<sentence>They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the1987 fiscal year starting on April 1, which includes the taxplans.</sentence>
		<sentence>They have been resorting to an on-off boycott ofparliament since February 4.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If I were Nakasone, I would close the current regularparliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled, attend the Venicesummit of industrial democracies in June and open anextraordinary session to discuss the tax plans," the aide said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under law, a regular session can be extended only oncewhile an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The otheroption would be to extend the current session, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidencemotion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another."</sentence>
		<sentence>One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening upthe way for tax reform.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabineten masse.</sentence>
		<sentence>A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower Housefor a snap general election," the aide said.</sentence>
		<sentence>That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resignfrom the 512-seat Lower House, necessitating by-elections.</sentence>
		<sentence>The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after itslandslide victory in general elections last July.</sentence>
		<sentence>There are five independents and three vacancies.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflatetheir seats, but at the expense of fierce media criticism," theaide said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have littleeffect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26.</sentence>
		<sentence>About 2,600 elections will be held in all but three of thenation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will alloppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets.</sentence>

		<subject>NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES</subject>
		<sentence>U.K. Interest rates look set to movelower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension ofa British National Savings issue yesterday.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Department of National Savings, effectively a TreasuryDepartment unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launchedin October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-yearprivate investments between 25 and 5,000 stg.</sentence>
		<sentence>A spokesman saidthe suspension was just a reaction to yields on nationalsavings bonds being way out of line with the rest of themarket.</sentence>
		<sentence>The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutestoday of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, thesecond such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said the near-instant sale of the entire new giltsissue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pctdownpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rateshad to drop sooner rather than later.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downwardpressure on money market rates remained intact, with thebellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at10-9-7/8 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>It coincided with another strong sterling rally whichpushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>"That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed," saidStephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokersPhillips and Drew; "It is an indication that the market believesrates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-pointimmediately after the budget (on March 17), and some peoplehope for more."</sentence>
		<sentence>Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by theNational Savings Department was "of considerable significance."</sentence>
		<sentence>It said, "the real message ... Is that the decks are beingquickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by thebuilding societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cutin bank base rates to 10 pct materialises."</sentence>
		<sentence>Building societies have said a drop in bank base rateswould normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to areduction in mortgage lending rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed theNational Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasurypolicy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.</sentence>
		<sentence>"National Savings has been competing too effectively withthe building societies of late.</sentence>
		<sentence>Building society income hasbeen depressed in recent months," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He and other analysts said Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lidon U.K. Inflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britainthan in most other Western economies with inflation seen risingwell above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 afterlast year's 3.7 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumerprices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rateswould reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Lewis and others noted that building societies had beencomplaining to the government about intense competition fromNational Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for earlymortgage rate cuts.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBRfunding from National Savings, but he must be taking thebuilding societies' criticism to heart.</sentence>
		<sentence>It looks like theNational Savings move reflects this," one senior dealer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on thisinterpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely areaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which hadpushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line withthe rest of the market.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We are not politically motivated ... Funding was justbecoming too expensive and we don't need all that money," hetold Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues atleast twice in the past, when offered interest rates were aboveor below market rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late asU.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline andincome was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billionstg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.</sentence>
		<sentence>In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving'scontribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg,compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of theprevious year, official figures show.</sentence>
		<sentence>Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show afurther increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing thetotal for 11 months above target, government officials said.</sentence>

		<subject>ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS</subject>
		<sentence>Lured by the weakening dollar and theconviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, Europeanenergy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reservesto replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said owning oil reserves in a politically stableUnited States is good insurance against future shortages.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated upcompetition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choicedomestic oil properties.</sentence>
		<sentence>Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil andgas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyershad helped push reserve prices in recent months higher.</sentence>
		<sentence>Allbuyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs abarrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 foracquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and fivedlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, butwe're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in," saidArthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist andpresident of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.    "Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil andgas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believethe trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 becauseof the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception thatoil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper tobuy new reserves than to explore for them.</sentence>
		<sentence>Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks tothe need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments andgeneral restructuring throughout the oilpatch.</sentence>
		<sentence>In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of <Total CompagnieFrancaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs toseparately acquire oil assets of Texas International <TEICC>and Lear Petroleum Partners <LPP>.</sentence>
		<sentence>A spokesman for Minatomesaid the company is searching for additional acquisitions.</sentence>
		<sentence>A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, <Petrofina S.A.>and <Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buyvirtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos <WMB>,the Oklahoma pipeline firm.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventureswith experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil.</sentence>
		<sentence>Japan's<Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's <TX> Texaco USA in a100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined withDupont's <DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.</sentence>
		<sentence>Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, itsgeographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil aremore important factors in evaluating potential acquisitionsthan relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representingInternational Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of <PreussagCorp> and <C.</sentence>
		<sentence>Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm hadearmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves inTexas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he called that a small amount compared to the amountother investors have for acquisitions.</sentence>
		<sentence>PaineWebber's GeodyneEnergy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend upto 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The competition is stiff, not only from other foreigninvestors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oilcompanies," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Our company is shopping around because wefeel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ifyou're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you needprices higher than the current market," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokeragehouses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were alsocompeting for prime properties.</sentence>
		<sentence>Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group<RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying andselling reserves, Smith said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since 1982, Shell has acquiredtwo billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels ofoil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of thesecompanies," Smith said.</sentence>

		<sentence>He said this was the first of two planned sales ofcorporate issues from the fund's portfolio.</sentence>
		<sentence>Zuckerman saidChrysler will sell slightly less than one billion dlrs ofcorporates.</sentence>

		<sentence>Corporate bond traders noted that Chrysler's sale occurredagainst the backdrop of a slightly weak secondary market.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said they believed that Chrysler was sold thecorporates at a large profit because the issues were bought bythe automaker for its portfolio when interest rates were muchhigher.</sentence>

		<sentence>Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supportedin some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries andsix areas of oil production.</sentence>
		<sentence>The state-oil company Petrobras requested the interventionbecause of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industryemployees.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government had already dispatched more than 1,000marines to occupy the country's main ports after a nationalseamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence>The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day,represents a stern challenge to the government.</sentence>
		<sentence>The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazildesperately needs foreign exchange.</sentence>
		<sentence>It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance whichprecipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision onFebruary 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofcommercial debt.</sentence>

		<sentence>One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said "it is apsychological war.</sentence>
		<sentence>They are using force and we are usingpeaceful methods."</sentence>

		<sentence>A group of state officials and a keyU.S. senator said a corporate merger wave was harming theeconomy and blamed the Reagan administration for laxness inenforcing the federal antitrust laws.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who chairs theSenate Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee, alsocautioned the Department of Justice (DOJ) to comply with hisrequest for a listing of each case since 1980 in whichdepartment officials had rejected a staff recommendation toprosecute a suspected antitrust violation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Metzenbaum had asked for the data by Monday, but the DOJfailed to meet the deadline and later hinted it might refuse tocomply.</sentence>
		<sentence>Acting Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust CharlesRule defended the administration's record on antitrustenforcement and told the panel at today's hearing that thedepartment was in the process of preparing a response toMetzenbaum's request.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We have nothing to hide, but we have to be concerned aboutour institutional interests," Rule said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He provided noexplanation of what those interests were.</sentence>

		<sentence>"Merger mania is rampantin this country...and it is not serving us well."</sentence>
		<sentence>Rule countered that the low inflation and interest ratesand the continuing economic expansion meant theadministration's policies were working well.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said simply looking at the number of challenges filedagainst pending mergers was misleading because there was noreason to believe that a fixed proportion of all mergers wereanticompetitive.</sentence>

		<sentence>Wall Street market analysts said twochanges in the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Averagewere part of a shift away from smokestack industries that havelong dominated the 30-stock index.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It strengthens the Dow," said William LeFevre, analyst atAdvest Inc.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Coca-Cola Co <KO>, one of the twoadditions, "is a genuine consumer stock as opposed to asmokestack."</sentence>
		<sentence>He applauded the decision to drop Inco Ltd <N>, "asuper stock at one time that hasn't done much lately."</sentence>
		<sentence>The editors of the Wall Street Journal also decided to addBoeing Co <BA> and dropping Owens-Illinois Inc <OI>.</sentence>
		<sentence>Charles Jensen of MKI Securities said Inco was a "stodgynumber."</sentence>
		<sentence>But he noted that putting two new stocks in an averageof 30 is a relatively minor change.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This will distinctly make the index more useful," saidFrank Korth of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "The movement ofthe market to the upside will be enhanced by the shift toCoke."</sentence>
		<sentence>But he said Shearson's aerospace analyst today removedBoeing from the firm's recommended list, taking it from a buyto a hold.</sentence>
		<sentence>Korth said Boeing's business appeared to be leaningtoo heavily to the military side as opposed to commercial.</sentence>
		<sentence>Prior to tomorrow's market opening the Wall Street Journalwill publish a new divisor to be used in calculating the index.</sentence>
		<sentence>LeFevre said the divisor will probably go up a bit but willprobably be lower than its current level of 0.889 later in theyear due to forthcoming splits in components such asInternational Paper Co <IP>.</sentence>
		<sentence>The divisor, which is adjusted whenver stocks are split,dropped below one for the first time in May of last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The0.889 divisor means that a change of 1/8 (12.5 cts) in theprice of a component produces a change of about 14 cts in theindex.</sentence>
