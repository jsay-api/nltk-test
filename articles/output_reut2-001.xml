		<sentence>He told reporters that volumes in North America increasedsome 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pctafter being flat for some years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentratingactivities on core businesses, had now been completed, henoted.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategicacquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level droppedthree pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc<CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring anyearnings dilution.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, it would not add much to profits, with much of thecompany's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about40 pct by end-1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>The same divergence was made in full year dividend, withUnilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and UnileverPlc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line withthe change in attributable profit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts ofChesebrough was due to be published shortly.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, he saidthat there was no target date for completing the process.</sentence>
		<sentence>He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped torealise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough hadpaid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, whichoperates outside Unilever's core activities.</sentence>

		<sentence>"The terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of themanufacturers," said analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley andCo. "They're called walkaway leases."</sentence>
		<sentence>AMR agreed to buy 15 planes from Boeing and 25 from Airbusbut said its American Airlines unit will lease the aircraft,which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers.</sentence>
		<sentence>AMR declined to value the deal, which analysts estimated atroughly 2.4 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>American Airlines will use theplanes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand itsservice in the Caribbean and to Europe.</sentence>
		<sentence>But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for theplanes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases.</sentence>
		<sentence>The carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-yearextension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 daysnotice by paying a small penalty, according to AMR chairmanRobert Crandall.</sentence>

		<sentence>A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co, the unit ofBoeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are partof the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements.</sentence>

		<sentence>One of General Electric Co's biggestbusinesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasingprofits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,Wall Street analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Previously, it was expected the business would peak anddecline at some point in the next five years.</sentence>
		<sentence>The improvedoutlook results from AMR Corp's <AMR> decision to order 40 newplanes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," saidNicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangementsfor its order of 15 Boeing Co <BA> and 25 <Airbus Industrie>twinjet long distance aircraft.</sentence>
		<sentence>But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allowit to operate the aircraft without adding to its debtstructure.</sentence>
		<sentence>AMR also has the right to decline delivery of theplanes or return them on short notice.</sentence>
		<sentence>The arrangement protectsAMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severedownturn in the economy.</sentence>
		<sentence>From GE's point of view the package looks like a good dealfor several reasons, Heymann said.</sentence>
		<sentence>GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time ofdelivery, Heymann noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planesGE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,would have little trouble rounding up another airline thatwanted the fuel efficient planes.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the whole, the dealappears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.</sentence>
		<sentence>GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares bymidafternoon.</sentence>
		<sentence>H.P.</sentence>
		<sentence>Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Uphamand Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no oneorder will have much of an effect on the stock."</sentence>
		<sentence>Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said theorder "will help to maintain a good level of production andprofitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE.</sentence>
		<sentence>Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet enginebusiness rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrsby 1991.</sentence>
		<sentence>Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs lastyear, with well over half of the business in the militarysector, according to analysts' estimates.</sentence>
		<sentence>The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincideswith an upbeat performance in other segments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the firstquarter of 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>Saying many will be suprised by the results,he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corpthat it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business andreshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with otherelements of its 14 business areas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the currentquarter.</sentence>
		<sentence>He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by theNBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.</sentence>

		<sentence>The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobondsecurities issued each year.</sentence>
		<sentence>In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs ofnew eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled byEuromoney magazine.</sentence>
		<sentence>Up until now, there have been no restrictions on leadmanaging eurobond issues.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank ofEngland is concerned about intense competition for market sharewhich may have caused some firms to expose themselves toimprudent credit risk.</sentence>
		<sentence>Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers asbanks compete to offer the best terms.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the new rulessuggest that some constraints may be placed on competition asregulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more riskthan it can handle.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banking sources said that while the Bank ofEngland is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing toaccept some constraints in order to ensure that underwritersact prudently.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank'slead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skilland experience of the lead underwriter in the particular marketconcerned...," the Bank's proposal said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Once a firm has received permission to act as leadunderwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of theface amount of the securities.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nominal exposure exceeding 60pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and itmust be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct ofcapital.</sentence>
		<sentence>The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite.</sentence>
		<sentence>Afterthat, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will beassessed at their full face value.</sentence>
		<sentence>The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities,revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthenits supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which calledfor comments from professionals by March 31 to allow theirpossible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its plannedfinal discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer.</sentence>
		<sentence>The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is thethird leg of the Conservative government's legislation for thesupervision of financial institutions.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act,aimed to bolster investor protection, and the BuildingSocieties Act, which put these institutions on an equal footingwith banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions betweenrecognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legalcontrols, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors.</sentence>
		<sentence>Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England inadvance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of theircapital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, preliminary consultations with bankrepresentatives had shown some of the initial proposals to beflawed, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on acase-by-case basis rather than along general lines.</sentence>
		<sentence>Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment ofexposures by financial institutions acting as banker to otherunits of their own group of companies, the paper showed.</sentence>
		<sentence>They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure tolocal governments and other public sector entities, and ofexposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor ascollateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed.</sentence>
		<sentence>Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within theirown group of companies would usually be looked into on acase-by-case basis under new proposals, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The paper said exposures to state-owned industries andother public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad shouldbe given the more lenient treatment of credits to governmentsprovided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees.</sentence>
		<sentence>It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities andthose guaranteed by the British Export Credit GuaranteeDepartment would probably not qualify for such treatment.</sentence>
		<sentence>On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary ofanother bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceilingcould be exceeded in individual cases.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertakingto take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and statein writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary'sbalance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said.</sentence>
		<sentence>On collateral security, it said this "should normally onlybe taken into account when considering the acceptability of abank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base."</sentence>
		<sentence>"The presence of security taken on its own will beconsidered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposurein excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptionalcircumstances and even then to a very limited extent," it said.</sentence>

		<subject>SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE</subject>
		<sentence>Soviet winter grains could be off toa faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry falland cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in theSoviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature toforecast any major crop problems, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the situation bears careful watching over the next sixweeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply andfuture buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty thatthe Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have alower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologistfor E.F. Hutton said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas willbe the crucial period that will determine the final outcome ofthe winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead ofus," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectaresof winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.</sentence>
		<sentence>This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter cropand would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, theUSDA analyst said.</sentence>
		<sentence>With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be ableto reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analystsnoted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.</sentence>
		<sentence>Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcovercombined with cold temperatures.</sentence>
		<sentence>This winter, however,snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has beendue to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Fall dryness may be a problem.</sentence>
		<sentence>There's a good correlationbetween mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normalin southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over theentire winter crop area, she said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which thesnowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, seniorforecaster for Accu Weather, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of thefall and winter, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The dry fall damaged pastures,the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring wouldrequire longer off-pasture feeding, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... theydon't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops andif they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was aone-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Sovietbuying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bad weather during the next six weeks could push theSoviets back into the market, weather analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month anda half," Martell said.</sentence>

		<subject>OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT</subject>
		<sentence>Crude oil prices rallied today, movingover 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determinedeffort to support prices, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this withoutanother meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due toseasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attemptto get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount fromthe official prices agreed to last december.</sentence>
		<sentence>The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministersof the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at theCooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Saudis have also offered to support members havingdifficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and toprevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPECmember will allocate some of their oil sales to help membersthat lose sales," Margoshes said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He added that the allocations would probably be in the formof loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in linenations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil.</sentence>
		<sentence>But itis also likely that such assistance would be provided toNigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPECpresident Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPECmeeting for fear that it would give the appearance that theDecember pact is falling apart.</sentence>
		<sentence>Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, UphamHarris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have beenoversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a shortcovering rally."</sentence>
		<sentence>He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, whichrefused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refinersinto the market to cover their short positions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the marketto but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideastsours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after tradingyeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into theNorth sea crude oil market.</sentence>
		<sentence>Traders said that there have been persistent rumors todaythat Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brentfor Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vesselsbeing fixed to make such shipments.</sentence>
		<sentence>North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with tradesreported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.</sentence>
		<sentence>OPEC members' denials that they are producing over theirquotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPECproduction was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to lastdecember but he gave no details on OPEC production againstclaims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The production probably is about their quota level andlargely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sellits oil as a result," Margoshes said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of thecurrent rally.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some believe prices can continue to rise ifSaudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.</sentence>
		<sentence>But others said that despite the rally today there werestill several fundamental factors, including demand, whichcould cut the rally short.</sentence>
		<sentence>Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, saidslow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keepdemand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to riseabout 1.4 pct over 1986.</sentence>

		<subject>COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS</subject>
		<sentence>Coffee prices may have to fall even lowerto bring exporting and importing countries once more round thenegotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates andtraders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The failure last night of International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agreeexport quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffeefutures markets today with the London May price reaching a4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne beforeending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previousclose.</sentence>
		<sentence>The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pressure will now build up on producers returning from theICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hopethe negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floorunder prices, some senior traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb forMarch 2.</sentence>
		<sentence>This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 centsa lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended inFebruary last year following a sharp rise in internationalprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and saidthey need to make hard commercial decisions.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If we have failedat the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now itis time to go and sell coffee."</sentence>
		<sentence>But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open.</sentence>
		<sentence>It plansto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop nextmonth, Dauster said.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is too difficult to forecast now.</sentence>
		<sentence>Tradesources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with aprevious crop of 11.2 mln.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil is defining details of publicselling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures marketlast year.</sentence>
		<sentence>A basic condition will be that it does not go back to themarket "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months.</sentence>
		<sentence>The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a splitbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick forfuture quotas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumers said "objective criteria" like averageexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,Dauster said.</sentence>
		<sentence>All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation butconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" wayof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongstproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members andnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas andthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a setratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate"policy to other producers.</sentence>
		<sentence>While consumer countries are welcometo participate they cannot dictate quotas which are verydifficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achievedifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICOand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared toaccept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it provesimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and toencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock ifsupplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumerargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICOsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapseand how much producers will sink their differences shouldprices fall further and remain depressed.</sentence>
		<sentence>The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 butboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if realnegotiations will begin then.</sentence>
		<sentence>The board is due to meet inIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.</sentence>
		<sentence>More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces andpolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries couldbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner thanmany imagine.</sentence>
		<sentence>In that case quotas could come into force duringthe summer.</sentence>
		<sentence>But most delegates and traders said quotas beforeOctober are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO hascontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.</sentence>
		<sentence>A clear difference between the pressures already being feltby importers and exporters was that consumers would have beenhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it couldnot be imposed now.</sentence>
		<sentence>At least in that way they said they couldshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.</sentence>
		<sentence>In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug theseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these tolapse should lasting agreement not be found.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after theirfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficientand we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. OFFICIALS SAY BRAZIL SHOULD DEAL WITH BANKS</subject>
		<sentence>The U.S. is sticking for the momentto its policy that Brazil, which two weeks ago suspended debtpayments to private banks, should deal with its creditors andnot with governments, U.S. officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't see any desire here to scurry around and helpBrazil until we get a better sense of what they are trying todo," a senior administration official stated.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Brazil has to do business through the banks at this point,"said another official following an assessment of that country'slatest debt crisis.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official, who asked that his name not be used, said theNational Security Council, the Treasury and State departmentsand other agencies held a meeting yesterday to discuss thesituation.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a related development, small regional banks that havemade loans to Brazil and other heavily-indebted Latin Americancountries, will meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volckerhere tomorrow.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil, with about 108 billion dlrs in debt, shocked bankslate last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billiondlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil's trade surplus, its main source of foreign exchangehas dwindled in recent months, making it difficult to serviceits debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official said the interagency meeting was called todiscuss "the general debt situation and compare notes on(Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro."</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro, who told reporters here that he wanted a politicaldiscussion with industrialized nations on Brazil's debtproblems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending fromofficial sources, held discussions here on Friday with Volcker,Treasury Secretary James Baker and other officials.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another senior administration official said he wasperplexed by Funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisiswith governments and not with creditor banks, at a time whenBrazil is in danger of losing short-term credit lines.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We are not clear at all on his tactics.</sentence>
		<sentence>To me it seemsbizarre, just bizarre," the official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>One official today described Funaro's argument as "nonsense,"and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to Brazil,for which that country was in arrears.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro has said Brazil acted to protect its reserves butwanted to avoid a confrontation.</sentence>
		<sentence>The consensus among administration officials seems to bethat Brazil's latest debt crisis is the result of the domesticeconomic problems.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Brazil is a special case, but there's no doubt they wouldnot be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up theireconomic policy," a senior official added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Several of the regional banks that will meet with Volckertomorrow declined to comment because the talks will be held atthe Fed's suggestion.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Since they are the hosts, we feel it's up to them if theywant to say something," one regional bank official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But other banking sources said that regional banks, many ofwhich are refusing to continue lending to Latin America, aredissatisfied with decisions of major banks such as Citibank, inthe refinancing of foreign debts.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources added that Volcker, for his part, isdissatisfied with some major banks' refusal to make interestrate concessions to Brazil and other Latin American debtors,and would like to see smaller creditor banks take a more actverole in the rescheduling process.</sentence>

		<subject>CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS</subject>
		<sentence>Chicago Board of trade grain traders andanalysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned tohandle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of newcrop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeansin the futures markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers willbe more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans becausecorn is protected by the acreage reduction program.</sentence>
		<sentence>That givesdeficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.</sentence>
		<sentence>Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if theysign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.</sentence>
		<sentence>With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thingrather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new cropsoybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans moreattractive under normal circumstances.</sentence>
		<sentence>An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift thelimited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mlnmore oat acres this year than last without being penalized,traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking ofshifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to themore attractive deal from the government, they added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just sixmonths ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South toput soybean land back into cotton.</sentence>
		<sentence>One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybeanproduction in recent years has been a general shift of acres intraditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Wall Street analysts said a sharerepurchase program announced by General Motors Corp is in partan attempt to placate shareholders angry over the recentrepurchase of shares from Texan H. Ross Perot last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>"He (Perot) was obviously the big trigger" said analystJoseph Phillippi of E.F. Hutton Co. "There was a firestorm ofcriticism from people on the institutional side."</sentence>
		<sentence>Wall Street analysts said the GM buyback will boost theshares in the near term but some had reservations about thelong term effects of the plan.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated bythe buyout of Ross Perot," said analyst David Healy of DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc.    Healy said General Motors chairman Roger Smith had beenhinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutionalinvestors.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the plan, which could cost more than fivebillion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to Ford MotorCo's <F> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basisthan that of Chrysler Corp <C>.</sentence>
		<sentence>Healy said General Motors will have to borrow money to buyback stock on a large scale.</sentence>
		<sentence>The General Motors plan, announced after a board ofdirectors meeting in New York, calls for repurchase of up to 20pct of the common stock by the end of 1990.</sentence>
		<sentence>The GM board also authorized repurchase of up to five mlnclass E <GME> and class H <GMH> shares.</sentence>
		<sentence>GM shares closed at75-5/8, up 7/8, in composite trading prior to the company'sannouncement.</sentence>
		<sentence>However subsequently Jefferies and Co, whichtrades NYSE-listed issues outside regular hours, said it wasmaking a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The stock is obviously going to be strong tomorrow," saidRonald Glantz, analyst at Montgomery Securities.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't know where the money (for the buyback) is comingfrom unless they borrow," Glantz said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Their credit rating isgoing to fall."</sentence>
		<sentence>GM said it anticipates a decrease in automotivecapital spending.</sentence>
		<sentence>Glantz believes GM could be inviting a strike this fall bygoing ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked forclosing.</sentence>
		<sentence>After deciding against a profit sharing bonus forworkers and buying out Perot for 743 mln dlrs "this will beseen as rubbing salt into the wound," Glantz said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"GM must bechallenging the union to make it the strike target."</sentence>
		<sentence>Glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on GMand expects the shares to rise.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he said he did not thinkthe overall plan was "prudent."</sentence>
		<sentence>"Obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap inthe stock tomorrow," Hutton's Phillippi said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He says GM apparently believes as a result of a costreduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels"they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within theconfines of their cash flow."</sentence>

		<sentence>European Community Farm CommissionerFrans Andriessen welcomed the agreement on details of dairyoutput cuts over two years and promised new measures to helpfarmers hurt by the drive to reduce EC surpluses.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We are now in a favourable position to improve thesituation in the dairy sector," he told a news conference.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Commission will be able to proceed with a 3.2 billionEuropean Currency Unit plan to dispose of over a mln tonnes ofbutter in EC stores, as the deal should prevent major newstocks from accruing.</sentence>
		<sentence>A preliminary accord on the dairy package was reached inDecember, but approval was held up by a row over Commissionproposals that it be given power to suspend sales of surplusstocks into store.</sentence>
		<sentence>After 36 hours of negotiations, ministers agreed detailedrules for such a suspension, allowing it only when new publicstocks of butter exceed 180,000 tonnes and when market priceswere sharply below those paid for sales into EC stores.</sentence>
		<sentence>Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for whathe said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals forcuts in EC farm price cuts, notably in cereals, in the comingseason.</sentence>
		<sentence>The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecupackage of measures to help farmers in difficulty and paycompensation to those who opt for less intensive productionmethods.</sentence>
		<sentence>Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objectionshad forced him to withdraw sections of this package, for whichhe had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow olderfarmers to take early retirement, either taking their land outof agricultural production or passing it to successors.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Commission is also working on proposals to enable theEC and member states to provide direct income supports tohard-pressed small farmers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Andriessen said he could not givefull details, but member state aid would be subject to "strictcriteria to avoid distortion of competition."</sentence>

		<sentence>Venezuela plans to have a public sectorforeign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when thepresent government of President Jaime Lusinchi ends its term,public finances director Jorge Marcano said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billiondlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageableamount which will assist in development plans.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bankadvisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year reschedulingaccord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8pct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>In an interview with El Universal newspaper, Marcano saidhe thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to dowith the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decisionto suspend interest payments.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of theU.S. Government, which urged several major banks to softentheir position in various debt renegotiations.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Brazilannouncement came later," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile,objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments.</sentence>
		<sentence>A pactwith Chile, with a one pct spread, came a day beforeVenezuela's.</sentence>
		<sentence>Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditorsseeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans,which are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Wecannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the newagreement and present the financing programmes we have," hesaid, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreignborrowing, which would come from banks and multilateralagencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the nexttwo years.</sentence>

		<sentence>Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta planthis month aimed at boosting exports to reach EuropeanCommunity levels, director-general of the INFE exportinstitute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross DomesticProduct over the next four years compared to 15 pct now," hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and thereis no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,which have a similar productive structure," he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct inreal terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand indeveloping countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went toOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)countries.</sentence>

		<sentence>A leaf disease affecting seven pct ofSri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year andraise currently depressed prices, industry officials andresearchers told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the RubberResearch Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus"corenes pora" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills theleaves.</sentence>
		<sentence>The disease was first discovered about six months ago.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade sources say prices might boom once again if thecrisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubberclones if no immediate action is taken.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the treesseriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to usechemicals to kill the disease," an Institute spokesman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Senior industry and research officials met yesterday atPadukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling thefungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the StatePlantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.</sentence>
		<sentence>The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubberland with the balance belonging to small private producers witha total of 145,600 hectares.</sentence>
		<sentence>The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the ResearchInstitute as high yielding and recommended two years ago forplanting.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only the two state groups seriously planted theseclones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but olderPBX Malaysian clones.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decidedto uproot only some of the affected trees while others would betreated.</sentence>
		<sentence>They declined to comment on other decisions taken.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past weekbut prices had hit their lowest since last December.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If thereis a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise," a spokesmanfor a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by aboutfour rupees a kilo between December and March.</sentence>
		<sentence>The best crepeone-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at thisweek's auction.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the sameperiod.</sentence>
		<sentence>Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an averageof 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes inDecember because of wintering in early February in producingareas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction withthe supply position showing improvements.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber lastmonth did not raise prices as on previous occasions.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks,meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed ofthe rubber we already had," one buyer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other sources said there were few forward contracts andspeculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivalsaggravated the problem.</sentence>

		<sentence>Manufacturer's share of the Europeanmarket.</sentence>
		<sentence>Opel/Vauxhall, with factories in West Germany, Spain andBritain, accounted for most of GM's sales in Europe with about1.3 million vehicles in 1986, officials said.</sentence>

		<sentence>"Alow dollar makes our prices very attractive," he told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>Using an average price of 13,000 dlrs per car, hisprojected sales figure would translate into between 91 millionand 104 mln dlrs in turnover, Fry added.</sentence>

		<subject>BUNDESBANK CHANGES REPURCHASE PACT SYSTEM</subject>
		<sentence>The Bundesbank is planning changes inthe system by which banks bid for funds in securitiesrepurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key openmarket instrument, central bank officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tenderprocess to two days from three currently, enabling theBundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if itchooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly.</sentence>
		<sentence>The changes will probably come into force in April.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the current system, banks must themselves specify atthe tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbankfor subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custodyaccounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks,which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in suchaccounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area.</sentence>
		<sentence>The change to come into force next month will allow theBundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself,in a process legally comparable to direct debiting.</sentence>
		<sentence>At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender onMonday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces theresult early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28days.</sentence>
		<sentence>But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts orlonger tender periods being necessary.</sentence>
		<sentence>For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Fridayto be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow(Thursday).</sentence>
		<sentence>The advance announcement took into account thecarnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurtyesterday (Tuesday).</sentence>
		<sentence>Central bank officials and money market dealers said theshortening of the tender process should be seen as purelytechnical, with no direct implications for interest rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter,"said an official at the Hesse LZB.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last Decemberthat security repurchase pacts had proved a much greatersuccess since their introduction in their present form twoyears ago, and praised their flexibility.</sentence>
		<sentence>The tender process changes will make the repurchase pactinstrument even more flexible, banking economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>By speeding up the tender process, they will make itpossible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts forperiods of less than a month, something long sought by banks,to respond to changing money market conditions.</sentence>
		<sentence>"With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will berefined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates," saidBerliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist HermannRemsperger.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to moneymarket developments, but by steering liquidity, not interestrates, he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>A rights issue of the order of 400 mln stg is seen, perhapsin June if there is no U.K. General election, they added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Midland Chairman Sir Donald Barron would not comment on therights question at a news conference.</sentence>
		<sentence>Earlier, Midland reported 1986 pre-tax profit of 434 mlnstg, up from 351 mln the previous year, in line with marketforecasts, dealers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Midland shares were up 14p at 633p.</sentence>
		<sentence>Midland said its 1986 results included Crocker NationalCorp for the first five months, prior to its sale last May.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ifresults were restated excluding distortions stemming from theCrocker sale they would show a 1986 pre-tax profit of 432 mlnstg compared with 366 mln, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Barron said that after the sale of Crocker andrestructuring during the last two years the group had "put thepast firmly behind us in 1986" and was now "focusing ourconsiderable resources on the exciting opportunities ahead."</sentence>
		<sentence>Chief Executive Sir Kit McMahon said U.K. Operations werethe main source of profits, with 83 pct or 434 mln stg.</sentence>
		<sentence>Both net interest income and non-interest income were aheadof 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>A key component in domestic asset growth was a 96 pct risein Midland's mortgage portfolio to 2.7 billion stg, comfortablyexceeding a 2.5 billion target, McMahon said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Overall sterlingadvances rose over 18 pct to 20.2 billion stg.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pre-tax profits in investment banking rose 27 pct to 65 mlnstg despite the heavy start-up and integration costs.</sentence>
		<sentence>However,this included the group's full range of activities in this areafrom its treasuries operations to its merchant bank tosecurities and gilts trading activities.</sentence>
		<sentence>No breakdown of this figure was given although McMahon saidventure capital activites contributed 17 mln stg to profit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hesaid the group's gilts trading was operating at a profitalthough its securities activities were not, but would give nofurther details.</sentence>
		<sentence>International banking profits rose 80 pct to 54 mln stg,benefitting from past restructuring and good performances fromEuropean subsidiaries.</sentence>
		<sentence>Crocker and the Bracton subsidiary created by Midland towork out Crocker's problem loans made a loss of 44 mln stg in1986 against a 35 mln loss in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bracton assets now stood at 300 mln dlrs and had been fullyprovisioned, McMahon said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Charges for bad and doubtful debts declined to 357 mln stgagainst 431 mln the previous year and the bank said thatexcluding Crocker, it would have been 320 mln.</sentence>
		<sentence>McMahon noted that total cover for bad debts had increasedto three pct of lendings in 1986 from 2.6 pct in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>He saidno evidence of increasing consumer credit delinquency and fewerU.K. Corporate defaults allowed for a lower domestic debtcharge in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>McMahon said Midland's exposure in South America remainedunchanged on 1985, with 1.4 billion stg outstanding to Brazil,1.3 billion to Mexico and 600 mln to Argentina.</sentence>
		<sentence>Following the lead of the other four major U.K. BanksMidland moved charges against lending to rescheduling countriesfrom general to specific provisions.</sentence>
		<sentence>This was the key factor behind a reduction in its tax rateto just under 40 pct in 1986 from 59 pct in 1985, McMahon said.</sentence>
		<sentence>One major problem still to be faced by the bank was tofurther reduce its cost/income ratio, which is still well aboveits competitors at 72 pct, he added.</sentence>

		<subject>FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE</subject>
		<sentence>The Federal Reserve Board votedunanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk ofinterest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effortto come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks thattakes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and otherassets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issuestoday by the Bank of England.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.</sentence>
		<sentence>The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risksassociated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchangecontracts and similar financial instruments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelinesfor calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activitiesthat banks would be required to take into account incalculating the minimum financial cushion they would need tomaintain.</sentence>
		<sentence>Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loansand other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk thatwould establish a bank's minimum capital needs.</sentence>
		<sentence>The additional guidelines proposed today would determinethe amount of capital support required for a bank's currentexposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.</sentence>
		<sentence>The current exposure would be measured by themark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect thereplacement cost.</sentence>
		<sentence>Potential future increases in the replacement cost would becalculated using credit conversion factors based on statisticalanalyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. bankingregulators.</sentence>
		<sentence>Future exposure would rise over the life of theasset.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balanceconflicting needs for precision and simplicity.</sentence>
		<sentence>They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of theparticular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Board officials said the new gauge could increase thecapital required of the largest money center banks, which arethe principal participants in these types of activities.</sentence>
		<sentence>They cautioned the Fed board to take account of thepotential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks tocompete in world financial markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the staff concluded, "The credit risks inherent insuch contracts now constitute a significant element of the riskprofiles of some banking organizations."</sentence>
		<sentence>The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largestparticipants in this market, on grounds the benefits ofincluding the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchangecontracts traded on organized exchanges.</sentence>
		<sentence>Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan wasnot involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capitalrules.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS</subject>
		<sentence>The Bank of England and the U.S. FederalReserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards tomeasure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do notshow up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and optionsinvolving interest or exchange rates, complements proposalsagreed in January between the two central banks to makecommercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similarstandards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said no final decisions had been reached yet and bankshave until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.</sentence>
		<sentence>"On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequatecapital support for potential future exposure -- on the otherhand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capitalrequirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. AndU.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively."</sentence>
		<sentence>At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of theso-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of acurrency or interest rate contract and an estimate of itspotential change in value due to currency or interest ratefluctuations until the contract matures.</sentence>
		<sentence>In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balancesheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one offive risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on thequality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of thecontract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, theplans showed.</sentence>
		<sentence>The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees wouldnot be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.</sentence>
		<sentence>They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of riskweights.</sentence>
		<sentence>The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S.And U.K.</sentence>
		<sentence>Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic nationalgovernment agencies, the proposals showed.</sentence>
		<sentence>The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spotforeign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures andoptions exchanges.</sentence>

		<subject>COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S.</subject>
		<sentence>Failure of talks on re-establishingInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last weekmay put political pressure on the United States, particularlythe State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. isunlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by"objective criteria", U.S. officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and headof Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on hisreturn from London that the United States is willing to resumethe coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rosenbaum said the United States will be "flexible" indiscussing the method of establishing objective criteria andany transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim ofestablishing an objective method of setting quotas.</sentence>
		<sentence>At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S.,proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculatedby a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportableproduction and verified stocks, while large producers led byBrazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division ofshares.</sentence>
		<sentence>The consumer position would have in effect reduced themarket share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to supportlegislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to complywith any future coffee quotas.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing thecoffee policy situation following the collapse of the Londontalks, but "nobody is proposing we change our position."</sentence>
		<sentence>However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffeepolicy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee marketoffensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,to soften the consumer position.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil willkind of want to test the resolve of other producers andconsumers," said one U.S. official.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, saidBrazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next fewmonths in an effort to drive down prices and pressure othercountries, particularly the splinter group of small producerswho differed with the major producers in London.</sentence>
		<sentence>This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from LatinAmerican countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to theU.S. State department, and to the National Security Council inthe White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffeepolicy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly frompolitically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombiaat the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based onobjective criteria.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the Dominican Republic and Costa Ricajoined the splinter group, which said it would agree toobjective criteria.</sentence>
		<sentence>There is a strong feeling among some in the StateDepartment that the United States should continue to supportthe splinter group of producers who have taken thepolitically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objectivecriteria question, U.S. officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Within the consuming countries there also is expected to besome pressure to reassess positions.</sentence>
		<sentence>In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., theNetherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand onthe issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nationsto successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was attimes qualified and there is some concern that the EuropeanCommunity could come under pressure to be more accommodative toproducers in future talks.</sentence>
		<sentence>France backed the Ivory Coast andother African producers during the talks.</sentence>
		<sentence>A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.</sentence>
		<sentence>While political manuevering by small producers andconsuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said thekey to any future outcome will be Brazil's position.</sentence>

		<sentence>Turkey expects a 1986 balance of paymentsdeficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is takingsteps to improve its performance in this and other fields, AliTigrel, director of economic planning at the State PlanningOrganisation said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence ofeconomic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.</sentence>
		<sentence>Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after adrop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasurywholesale index last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>This year's target of 20 pct "might be attainable but theeconomic management will have to be careful," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programmewhich is central to the government's economic planning, saidTurkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current accountshortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We must alleviate the current account substantially tosustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secureover the last five years," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>His comment echoed last October's Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development report on Turkey, which saidAnkara's case for more medium-term financing on better termswould look better if inflation were lower and the currentaccount deficit cut or turned into a surplus.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sectorinvestments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as apercentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visibleimprovement in the current account deficit," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year wasalso to blame for the high deficits.</sentence>
		<sentence>Appropriations to government departments had been cut byeight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreignborrowing by municipalities had been restrained.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to theinvestment programme and do not exceed their appropriations," hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowingrequirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated5.6 pct in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was alsotargeted, Tigrel said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Measures were being taken to encourageexports, and production incentives were being considered.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We must try to make sure that more capacity is injectedinto the Turkish economy in the coming years.</sentence>
		<sentence>The promotionpolicy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment andlocal private capital come more into play as far asmanufacturing capacity is concerned," Tigrel said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkisheconomy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still underway.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange ratepolicy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be donein a country where the state still dominates industry and thecurrency is only partially convertible.</sentence>

		<subject>ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION</subject>
		<sentence>Drilling for oil in California islikely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levelsdespite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analystssaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Because much of the crude oil in California fields isthick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have toincrease to near 1985's levels before any significant recoveryis seen in drilling, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,"said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.    Few new wells now are being drilled.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, comparedto about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger OilInformation Services, which tracks California drillingactivity.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state'sdrilling activity.</sentence>
		<sentence>Current prices are not enough to justify increaseddrilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California IndependentProducers Association.</sentence>
		<sentence>While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pactto curb production boosted oil prices early this year, priceseventually fell.</sentence>
		<sentence>Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, haveslumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a highof about 17 dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>More than half of California's oil comes from stripperwells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and thatmuch of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel toextract, Malmgreen said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,"Malmgreen said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many stripper wells along the southern California coastproduce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inlandwells frequently require the use of steam injection to spurextraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The outlook for future production in California is cloudedby a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, whichproduces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratorydrilling has slowed to a crawl.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell ofthe state energy commission.</sentence>
		<sentence>So far this year only fiveexploratory wells have been drilled.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't think they'll even get to what they did lastyear," Mitchell said.</sentence>
		<sentence>No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest ofthe decade, Mitchell said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in thenumber of producing wells and overall production.</sentence>
		<sentence>Between February and October of 1986, the number ofproducing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 frommore than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California EnergyCommission.</sentence>
		<sentence>In line with that decrease, California's crude oil outputfell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and isexpected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Between February and October 1986, California's crude oilproduction slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrelsper day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department ofConservation.</sentence>

		<subject>TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS <GM></subject>
		<sentence>General Motors Corp staged an explosiverally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announcedyesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded bystiff competition and erosion of market share.</sentence>
		<sentence>GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analystsagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of KidderPeabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancingshareholder value."</sentence>
		<sentence>However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for thebuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker torecapture lost market share.</sentence>
		<sentence>After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buyback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990.</sentence>
		<sentence>Theannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.</sentence>
		<sentence>The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on thestock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and atleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on agood performance expected from new car models.</sentence>
		<sentence>But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said therepurchase program is not a positive.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook andputs more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM willhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases.</sentence>
		<sentence>The stockshould settle back down to around 76, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from fourdlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domesticcar and truck market falling in 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>"On balance, GM cars arenot selling as well as their competitors," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from theyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> andChrysler Corp <C> both posted increases.</sentence>
		<sentence>But GM said Februarysales showed improvement over January, adding that it expectsimprovement in coming months.</sentence>
		<sentence>Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fallto around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The numbers include imports.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and productimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by thefourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.</sentence>
		<sentence>"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling upits sleeves and getting serious.</sentence>
		<sentence>I think there's a majorearnings surprise in the winds," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, inpart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The company is moreconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuationwith respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currentlyfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield thanits competitors, Kirnan said.</sentence>
		<sentence>And GM will raise the cashdividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.</sentence>
		<sentence>But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Incsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, ifsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of itsmarket share.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that willonly curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middleof the bulls and bears.</sentence>
		<sentence>While he is recommending GM stock, hesaid results will not improve until 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I'm not looking for improvement this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>This is atransition year for GM," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will notaffect 1987 results.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN LOW GROWTH MODEL</subject>
		<sentence>Healthy growth in corporate profits and inconsumer spending, the two pillars on which Japan rests itshopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at thecore, economists polled by Reuters said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replaceexports as the engine of growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>But close ties betweencorporate performance and wages mean that the alternativeeconomic model promises little but slower growth, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turnwill cut sales and further reduce profits.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improvedterms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domesticdemand grow steadily.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, this would happen only if household spendingincreased in line with the value of real financial assets dueto stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered asprofits from domestic sales improved compared with those fromexports.</sentence>
		<sentence>"No clear sign of such developments has so far beenevidenced," the central bank said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growthwill be slow, even though Japan's terms of trade have improvedsharply due to the strong yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economist David Pike of Phillipsand Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pctwhile output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large pricemargin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companiesdid not pass that advantage on to the consumer.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between thefall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop inconsumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms oftrade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors.</sentence>
		<sentence>The economists, however, believe this layer of fat willprotect companies for only a short while.</sentence>
		<sentence>As more firms seekmore profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domesticcompetition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports.</sentence>
		<sentence>Retail prices will fall.</sentence>
		<sentence>Profit margins will suffer.</sentence>
		<sentence>A December survey by top business organisation Keidanrenconfirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves.</sentence>
		<sentence>Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in productionvolume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance,said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara.</sentence>
		<sentence>Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cuttingunprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors(which employ significant numbers of workers), holding downwages, and reducing bonuses.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government has said it fearsunemployment could soon double from three pct now.</sentence>
		<sentence>Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurtsales.</sentence>
		<sentence>But reduced bonuses, and worries about individualfinancial security could be even more damaging.</sentence>
		<sentence>Twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with whatamounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them tobuy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza.</sentence>
		<sentence>To save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tiedbonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists also predict Japanese will not save less thanthe average 16 pct of salary they do now.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the contrary, apoor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen theresolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education,and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary.</sentence>
		<sentence>The last government survey of public opinion said over 80pct of citizens will continue to economise.</sentence>
		<sentence>Japan has a rapidlyageing population and minimal social security and its workersfear poverty in their old age.</sentence>
		<sentence>Faced with such a vicious circle, the government'sreflationary strategies are severely limited.</sentence>
		<sentence>The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party andFinance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in smallsupplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentivewithout reducing revenue.</sentence>
		<sentence>Independent economists have been lessthan excited at the results.</sentence>
		<sentence>Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited.</sentence>
		<sentence>The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politicallyimpossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rateat only 0.25 pct, Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in somekind of deposit, official figures show.</sentence>
		<sentence>Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive whilefirms are planning cuts in capital investment.</sentence>
		<sentence>The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and landprices are the only current results of high liquidity.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fear of inflation also limits policy options.</sentence>
		<sentence>Politicalanalysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 bigelection victory largely to a long period of almost zero priceinflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>And he found this year that attempts to impose asales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition.</sentence>

		<sentence>U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are askingbanks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushionthem against the risks posed by the interest rate and currencyswap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today bythe Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers saidthat in effect, regulators are asking them to set asidereserves twice for the same risk.</sentence>
		<sentence>Market participants will have 60 days to respond to theproposals.</sentence>
		<sentence>Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especiallysignificant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volumeof about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiledby Euromoney magazine.</sentence>
		<sentence>While no firm figures exist, dealers ineurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involvedin some swap arrangement.</sentence>
		<sentence>Separately, the ISDA estimates thatabout 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions areoutstanding.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of theInternational Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President ofKleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Associationhas no comment and will study the proposals.</sentence>
		<sentence>"What they are proposing is really double counting," Patrickde Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanleyand Co, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Instead, he argues, banks should either berequired to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pctper year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost ofreplacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The potential risk factors are very large relative to whatwe had expected," said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>"What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you mighthave 10 years from now," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>(Adds title first paragraph).</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered bythe agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have acompetitive advantage because they will not have to pass thecosts on to customers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about theexclusion of other countries from the new requirements.</sentence>
		<sentence>FederalReserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of theproposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned thatJapan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft newcapital rules.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bankregulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a singlecounterparty against each other.</sentence>
		<sentence>The paper said that regulatory authorities "recognize thatsuch arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reducecredit risk."</sentence>
		<sentence>Furthermore, the paper said, if a nettingagreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, itmight be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.</sentence>
		<sentence>But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on anairtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.</sentence>
		<sentence>"One problem is that there has never been a major defaultin the swaps market.</sentence>

		<sentence>"The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meantthat the government is now able to maintain lower cash balancesand lower financing costs," said Bouey who was replaced bydeputy governor John Crow last month.</sentence>

		<sentence>The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by aneight billion dlr decline in the government's financingrequirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, andgeneration of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchangetransactions.</sentence>

		<sentence>Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME,directors have postponed action on a membership petitioncalling for a ban on dual trading, CME Chairman Jack Sandnertold Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consideration of the petition was scheduled for a regularboard meeting today, but directors first wanted the opinions ofa special committee that has been studying trading conditionsin the Standard and Poor's 500 futures pit for the last sixmonths.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We didn't want to preempt the committee," Sandner said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Instead, Sandner said the board will wait for the findingsof the special S and P committee, which is considering sometype of restriction on dual trading in S and P 500 futures.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dual trading is the legal practice in which an exchangemember can execute customer orders as well as trade for his ownaccount.</sentence>
		<sentence>Critics maintain the practice provides an opportunityfor traders to "front-run" or trade their own accounts at morefavorable prices before customer orders are executed.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sandnersaid he expects the special committee to report its findingslate next week and the board to act when those findings arepresented.</sentence>
		<sentence>In response to reports that the CME board is opposed to aban on dual trading, Sandner pointed out that the board alreadyunanimously approved a partial ban on dual trading in S and P500 futures at a prior meeting.</sentence>
		<sentence>The change was withheld, however, at the request of thespecial committee after a study was released and the committeefelt the issue should be addressed more comprehensively,Sandner said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sandner said that he personally had no aversion to a ban ondual trading and "the leadership (of the CME) is not opposed toa ban on dual trading."</sentence>

		<sentence>The Texas Democrat's idea as first presented to House Waysand Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski this week wouldtax sales and purchases of securities.</sentence>
		<sentence>A tax of 0.25 to 0.5percent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rostenkowski, the chief taxwriter, considers it too earlyto back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securitiestransfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review bycongressional tax analysts, a spokesman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Illinois Democrat has repeatedly stressed this year heis reluctant to back a tax increase so long as President Reaganmaintains his staunch opposition.</sentence>
		<sentence>"First we've got to decide whether to raise additionalrevenues.</sentence>

		<sentence>The Budget Committeewill recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in1988, but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decisionon how the taxes will be raised.</sentence>
		<sentence>The securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount ofrevenue to ease Congress's difficult task of trimming thedeficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target.</sentence>

		<sentence>A senior British official said thatprotectionist bills being considered by Congress could triggerretaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten theglobal trading system.</sentence>
		<sentence>Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said ifCongress passed legislation to curb textile imports, whichwould hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asiantextile producers, "the community would have to retaliate."</sentence>
		<sentence>His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian TradeMinister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, thecommunity would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.</sentence>
		<sentence>Channon made his remarks at a news conference after twodays of talks with Reagan Administration officials and membersof Congress.</sentence>
		<sentence>De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment inCongress since his visit here last year as Congress and theAdministration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. tradedeficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation toforce Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.</sentence>
		<sentence>Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyoneproblems - its surplus with the United States last year was51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The more united pressure there could be, the better," hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation toavoid trade disputes.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontationearlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain andPortugal joined the community and its liberal importsregulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," hesaid, ""it does not mean that they would do so on anotheroccasion."</sentence>
		<sentence>Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment inEurope over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressureof unilaterally imposed deadlines."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft andtaxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United Statesmust therefore learn to manage their relations better."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said another bill to let the United States retaliateagainst a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement onTariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.</sentence>

		<sentence>Trans World Airlines Inc complicatedthe bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buyPiedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge withPiedmont and USAir.</sentence>
		<sentence>Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Streetspeculated the board was discussing opposing bids from NorfolkSouthern Corp and USAir.</sentence>
		<sentence>The TWA offer was announced shortlyafter the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.</sentence>
		<sentence>TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share.</sentence>
		<sentence>Italso said it was the largest shareholder of USAir andthreatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offerfor 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.</sentence>
		<sentence>TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal forUSAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it saidit alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of theairlines.</sentence>
		<sentence>Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairmanCarl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline intothe takeover arena.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWAinto play.</sentence>
		<sentence>There's speculation on the street he just wants tomove onto somthing else," said one arbitrager.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We think TWAmight just be putting up a trial balloon."</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,but that the airline will probably reject it because the priceis relatively low compared to other airline deals.</sentence>
		<sentence>They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible byrevealing financing arrangements.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They need to show theircommitment and their ability to finance.</sentence>
		<sentence>I think it's acredible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think it's certainly on the low end of relative valuesof airline deals," said Pettee.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pettee estimated 58 dlrs wouldbe in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.</sentence>
		<sentence>USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer.</sentence>
		<sentence>Aspokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had notchanged its offer for Piedmont.</sentence>
		<sentence>USAir offered of buy 50 pct ofthat airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balancefor 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.</sentence>
		<sentence>USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mlnshares.</sentence>
		<sentence>Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, alsoremained silent on the TWA action.</sentence>
		<sentence>Piedmont has an outstanding65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck withits offer for Piedmont.</sentence>
		<sentence>Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmontand opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeoverof Piedmont.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir tomake his own airline a more attractive takeover target.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and therewere no takers.</sentence>
		<sentence>I think the strategy might have called formaking his investment more attractive.</sentence>
		<sentence>One way to accomplishthat specific objective is to go out and acquire otherairlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least thisway it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Icahn's financing ability for such a transactionremains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.</sentence>
		<sentence>Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to dothe offer.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financialadvisers and plans to make his own arrangements.</sentence>
		<sentence>Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp <X>and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan wasimpacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.</sentence>
		<sentence>Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWAoffer on price and financing concerns.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's littered withcontingencies and it doesn't even have a financingarrangement," said one executive at another major airline.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be astrong contender with USAir's east coast route system andplanned west coast presence from PSA.</sentence>
		<sentence>USAir could feed theintenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence inits St. Louis hub.</sentence>
		<sentence>Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,to the mix would develop an even stronger force.</sentence>
		<sentence>The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservationsystem.</sentence>
		<sentence>Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it wouldresult in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.</sentence>

		<subject>INTERNATIONAL BORROWING REACHES RECORD IN 1986</subject>
		<sentence>Record high borrowing of 376 billion dlrsin 1986 on international capital markets was supported by alarge volume of debt refinancing and growing integrationbetween national and international markets, the OECD said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) said in its latest Financial Market Trends report the 34pct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes inthe relative importance of the instruments used ininternational financing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Straight bond offerings, equity related securities andeuro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financingrose to their highest level this decade.</sentence>
		<sentence>The markets forfloating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined.</sentence>
		<sentence>The OECD said another striking feature of internationalcapital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration oflending to the OECD group of western industrialised countries,which accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Factors behind the heightened pace of activity included anotable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowingthrough the flotation of fixed-interest securities.</sentence>
		<sentence>This in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with newtechniques such as interest rate and currency swaps.</sentence>
		<sentence>Stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion ofequity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of arapidly expanding market for euro-equities.</sentence>
		<sentence>A slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowerswas more than offset by a large volume of refinancingoperations induced by improved market conditions and strongerdebt management policies.</sentence>
		<sentence>Growing integration with nationalmarkets meant the arrival of a large number of new players oninternational markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>It added the development of a smoothly-functioning marketfor short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwrittenissuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative totraditional forms of bank lending.</sentence>
		<sentence>Turning to 1987, the OECD pointed to indications of apossible slowdown of international markets' expansion andpossibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said many market participants saw little scope for afurther decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown inthe pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead.</sentence>
		<sentence>It saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline indemand of recent years, although it was likely more borrowerswould try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities providedby the market for euro-commercial paper.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It remains to be seen however to what extent the ECP marketwill be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper fromlower-rated borrowers," the report said, adding that any majoradvance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity wouldrequire a significantly broader investor base.</sentence>

		<sentence>"That's a huge growtharea," he said, adding that it will run the gamut from foreignproducer countries to foreign independent operators.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said it would be difficult to develop a futurescontract based on an internationally traded crude although hepreviously said the exchange is exploring that possibility.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Trying to develop a futures contract in any other crudebesides West Texas Intermediate will be a tough task" he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Marks said it is more likely a futures contract based onan international product rather than an international crudewill be developed since the products market is more diverse.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hesaid previously the exchange is studying the possibility ofdeveloping a non-U.S. deliverable products contract.</sentence>

		<sentence>In addition, sluggish U.S. economic data and little signthat the economy will pick up its pace in the near future maybe enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analystssaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The market is paying more attention to the weakened stateof the economy right now," said Refco analyst Mike Connery.</sentence>
		<sentence>Connery said the four pct drop in January U.S. factoryorders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growthwill be slow.</sentence>
		<sentence>Connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in theLombard rate after sluggish West German industrial productionfigures also provided some support.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The domestic economies of the major trading partners ofthe U.S. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will beforced to ease," thus paving the way for a more accomodativeU.S. credit policy, added John Michael, analyst at FirstOptions of Chicago.</sentence>
		<sentence>Michael pointed out, however, that trimming the U.S. tradedeficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of majorindustrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The surplus (for exporters to the U.S.) is bullish forbonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ratherthan translate those into their own currencies and sufferexchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments,"Michael said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections saidsome of the late strength in the bond market resulted frombuying by Japanese interests.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurredafter the June bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The breakout is pretty important," said chartist LeslieKeefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Not only did bondsclose above recent highs but they were also above the sidewayspattern we've been in for the last three months."</sentence>
		<sentence>Also positive on a technical basis was the fact that theJune bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, andthat the rally occurred on heavy volume, Keefe said.</sentence>

</subject>

	<article id=”1895">
		<subject>REAGAN ADMITS IRAN ARMS OPERATION A MISTAKE</subject>
		<sentence>President Reagan, fighting to regainpublic confidence in the wake of the Iran arms scandal,admitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as anarms-for-hostages deal and, "It was a mistake."</sentence>
		<sentence>"When it came to managing the NSC (National SecurityCouncil) staff, let's face it, my style didn't match itsprevious track record," Reagan said in a television address tothe American people.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I have already begun correcting this," he added in hisprepared remarks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan's speech, widely regarded as critical to his hopesof repairing his presidency, was his first detailed response tolast week's scorching Tower commission report on the secretsale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits to U.S.-backedcontra rebels in Nicaragua.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while hewaited for the truth to come out and admitted, "I've paid aprice for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said that a few months ago, he told the American peoplehe did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covertoperation.</sentence>
		<sentence>"My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true,but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not," Reagan said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses.</sentence>
		<sentence>It was amistake," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan again said that the original Iran initiative was todevelop relations with those who might assume leadership in apost-Khomeini government.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's clear from the Board's report however that I let mypersonal concern for the hostages spill over into thegeo-political strategy of reaching out to Iran.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare thatI didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan,"he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The commission, headed by former Republican Sen. JohnTower, said Reagan's "intense compassion" for Americans beingheld by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had resulted in anunprofessional and unsatisfactory policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>It portrayed 76-year old Reagan as a man who did not knowor care much about the wide-ranging, probably illegalactivities of his National Security Council (NSC) staff, whichhatched the operation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan said he endorsed all of the Tower commission'srecommendations about the running of the NSC, adding, "In fact,I'm going beyond its recommendations, so as to put the house ineven better order."</sentence>
		<sentence>He noted that he had appointed former Senate Republicanleader Howard Baker as his new chief of staff and said he hopedBaker would help him forge a new partnership with Congress,"especially on foreign and national security policies."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said his new national security adviser, Frank Carlucci,was rebuilding the national security staff "with propermanagement discipline."</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan said that almost half the NSC professional staff nowconsisted of new people.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said that FBI Director William Webster, his new nomineeto head the CIA, "understands the meaning of 'rule of law'".</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan also announced that Tower had agreed to serve as amember of his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which actsas a watchdog on the nation's covert activities.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he said that he had issued a directive barring the NSCstaff itself from undertaking covert operations -- "No ifs,ands, or buts."</sentence>
		<sentence>Tonight's speech was a far cry from Reagan's initial strongdefense of his Iran policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a televised speech last November 13, Reagan calledcharges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the U.S. war onterrorism "utterly false."</sentence>
		<sentence>As recently as two months ago in his State of the Unionspeech, Reagan said that "serious mistakes were made" butdefended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals.</sentence>
		<sentence>By contrast, tonight's speech had an apologetic tone thatwas a marked departure from Reagan's usual upbeat, confidentdemeanor.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said he took full responsibility for his own actions "andfor those of my administration."</sentence>
		<sentence>"As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without myknowledge, I am still accountable for those activities.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asdisappointed as I may be in some who served me, I am still theone who must answer to the American people for this behavior,"Reagan said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan said the message that the nation should move on hadcome from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, from alliesaround the world -- "and if we're reading the signals right,even from the Soviets."</sentence>
		<sentence>His remark seemed to be a reference to a new Sovietwillingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-rangenuclear missiles in Europe.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - INDONESIA'S ECONOMY</subject>
		<sentence>Indonesia heads for general elections insix weeks' time with its economy in the worst shape in 20years, economists and officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government expects no spillover of "people power" fromthe neighbouring Philippines to unsettle the 20-year rule ofPresident Suharto, victory for whose ruling Golkar party in thecoming parliamentary elections is assured.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Western diplomats said it is the country'sdeteriorating economic position that is the main threat to itsstability.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year's collapse in oil prices dealt a heavy blow toIndonesia, halving its revenue from oil and gas exports to 6.5billion dlrs last year from 12.4 billion in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Oil and gasaccount for 70 pct of export income.</sentence>
		<sentence>The result is that in the run-up to April 23 elections,Suharto, far from wooing his 168 mln countrymen with payincreases or tax cuts, is busy slashing budget spending.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government has also recently increased transport faresand frozen the pay of the civil service and the army for thesecond year running, despite inflation now estimated at 8.8pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>The current account deficit rose to 4.09 billion dlrs in1986 from 1.8 billion in 1985, while the debt service ratiowidened to 33.2 pct for 1987 from 25 pct in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>Foreign debt repayments of 4.6 billion dlrs account foralmost a third of the 1987/88 budget.</sentence>
		<sentence>A recent U.S. Embassy report on the economy said 1986 grossdomestic product growth was the lowest since the mid-1960s whenSuharto came to power.</sentence>
		<sentence>Western economists said GDP registerednil growth or contracted last year after 1.9 pct growth in1985, and predicted only a one pct rise this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>In its efforts to return to growth seen in the oil-boomyears of the 1970s when the economy grew an average seven pct,the government is now relying more on foreign borrowings.</sentence>
		<sentence>Indonesia has asked foreign governments to finance itsshare of new projects being built with overseas money, becauseit cannot afford even to meet local costs.</sentence>
		<sentence>In the last three months Indonesia has taken out new loanstotalling 1.55 billion dlrs, on top of its external debt of 37billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Western bankers said more will be needed, and thecountry now ranks sixth among Third World debtors.</sentence>
		<sentence>A 350 mln dlr commercial loan signed in Tokyo in Decemberwas followed in the first week of February with a 300 mln dlrloan from the World Bank to support the balance of payments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last month, Japan's Export-Import Bank agreed a 900 mln dlrloan to meet Indonesia's share of 21 World Bank projects whichwould otherwise have been scrapped or postponed.</sentence>
		<sentence>More loans areon the way, including two more from the World Bank worth atotal 300 mln dlrs for roads and irrigation.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz said in a recent speech thateconomic growth remains the key to preserving Indonesia'sfundamental stability.</sentence>
		<sentence>The largest Moslem nation in the world, Indonesia has sofar avoided some of the more extreme paths of other Moslemcountries.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the World Bank has warned that mountingunemployment could start causing severe social strains unlessit is tackled.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said in its annual report on Indonesia last June thatunless economic growth is revived, unemployment could reachwhat it termed "unacceptable levels."</sentence>
		<sentence>Unemployment was officially put at 4.8 pct at the end oflast year, but those considered underemployed number around 35pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>What path to take appears to be a matter of some disputewithin Suharto's government, with his Western-trainedtechnocrats advocating more of the classic remedies supportedby the international financial community.</sentence>
		<sentence>But another group supports a protected economy, with moreimport substitution, the U.S. Embassy report said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government devalued the rupiah by 31 pct against thedollar last September to help exports and curb imports, and iscurrently working on a series of measures to further encourageforeign investment and boost exports outside the oil sector.</sentence>
		<sentence>The direction Suharto takes could affect Indonesia'sability to raise new loans in the future, Western bankers say.</sentence>
		<sentence>So far, despite three packages of economic measures overthe past nine months, he has not touched key monopolies thatare linked to businesses controlled either by his family or bybusiness associates, diplomats and bankers say.</sentence>
		<sentence>Diplomats and investors are now looking for action onmonopolies and the loss-making state sector as signs thatSuharto is serious about tackling the country's problems.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EUROYEN BOND ISSUES INCREASE</subject>
		<sentence>The easing of rules governing overseas useof the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity buthas failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency,bond managers and traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues inthe Eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keepingthe yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but theJapanese, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>This lack of real yen demand through thefreer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 U.S. And Japaneseaccord to internationalise the yen, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japaneseinterest rates but have no need for yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>They arrange primarilywith Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into othercurrencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>More than 85pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The borrowers don't care which currency they use.</sentence>
		<sentence>They areonly after attractive money," one bond trader said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previousyear, boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of thetotal Eurobond market, Koichi Kimura, managing director ofDaiwa Securities Co Ltd, said recently.</sentence>
		<sentence>Traders said some of the activity stems from battles amongJapanese and foreign securities companies and banks for theprestige of placing a larger share of issues.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many even resortto "harakiri" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the fever continues and the number of offerings coulddouble again in 1987, said Naoki Yokoyama, manager of NikkoSecurities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up byJapanese trust banks, one trader said.</sentence>
		<sentence>After a 90 day waitingperiod the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite isstrong, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when moreattractive yields are offered on dollar and other currencyinvestments, traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing(in yen)," said Masaki Shimazu, manager of Daiwa's bonddepartment.</sentence>
		<sentence>While few foreigners are interested in the secondarymarket, Japanese commercial banks, regional banks, lifeinsurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy thebonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offerlittle currency risk, traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waitingperiod before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from180.</sentence>
		<sentence>A ministry official said it verified through sampling thatreflow was fairly small.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in theEuroyen market," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>One trader said that although demand from Japaneseinvestors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term.</sentence>
		<sentence>He saidmany investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S.Interest rates decline further.</sentence>
		<sentence>To encourage further international use of the yen, theministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyencommercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studyingdemand from potential borrowers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Securities company sources believe the ministry will permitnon-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the nextfew months.</sentence>
		<sentence>But they expect it to continue to ban domesticparticipation in the market for some time to come.</sentence>
		<sentence>Japanesebanks object to the short-term paper market which they seeencroaching on their business territory.</sentence>
		<sentence>Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur moredemand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shiftinto shorter-term securities if need be.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps," one bondmanager said.</sentence>
		<sentence>If more financial instruments were available,there might be more trades in yen, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, thoughsome recent issues which are callable in three years work as ifthey had shorter maturities, traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bondmaturities within a few months.</sentence>
		<sentence>One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authoritiesare giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rulesgoverning international transactions of the yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>But freer useof the yen could encourage more trade settlements in theJapanese currency, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If exporters or importers can raisefunds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using theJapanese yen as a settlement currency," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Finance Ministry official said the government mustconstantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit ofborrowers and investors.</sentence>

		<subject>NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN</subject>
		<sentence>The highly visible drama involving theyen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the factthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against majorEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange ratedistortions, Japanese and European research officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statementsby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters thecurrency movements of the past two years are also creating afundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up newtrade tensions and imbalances.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade figures show that the new currency alignments arealready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.</sentence>
		<sentence>In many ways, not least in terms of rare internationalcooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact betweenthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut downthe value of the dollar was a historic one.</sentence>
		<sentence>But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the majorcurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in whichthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but notnecessarily central significance, the officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The officials said that when the Plaza agreement tookplace, the dollar was already on its way down.</sentence>
		<sentence>The agreementsimply helped it on its way.</sentence>
		<sentence>Senior EC financial expert inTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.</sentence>
		<sentence>"You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,and that was well before Plaza," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at263.15 yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was242.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention andperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, thedollar trend has been down, down, down.</sentence>
		<sentence>Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>The historical crossrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story.</sentence>
		<sentence>TheEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>The close relationship between exchange rates and tradeflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, butundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three ischanging.</sentence>
		<sentence>In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the ECboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half ofof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exportsand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have atremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unitsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is importantto them.</sentence>
		<sentence>Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that islaying the golden egg," said de Hora.</sentence>
		<sentence>The EC is worried.</sentence>
		<sentence>EC business also had a remarkable yearin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to itsstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive thanU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rateimbalance, and which will cause problems.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC isreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries.</sentence>
		<sentence>Buttherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitiveedge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First InternationalEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If you wantmy objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in ourtrade imbalance.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,and this year we may have to do so again," he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and thefirm set up before the end of the month, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The scheme is intended to improve financial management atthe banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debtsturning bad, the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last week's announcement by Brazil that it wouldindefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanesecreditors to finalise the project, the sources said.</sentence>

		<sentence>The outlook for the WestGerman economy is relatively bright, with gross nationalproduct expected to expand by three pct this year, KielUniversity's Institute for World Economy said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leadingeconomic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimisticthan that of the other institutes, some of which have recentlyreduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's exportoutlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark'sstrength against the dollar and other major currencies.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all inall, limited," the report said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"On the contrary, a slight risein exports can be expected."</sentence>
		<sentence>The institute said past experience has shown West Germanexporters will move to counterbalance currency factors bycutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjustingtheir product ranges.</sentence>
		<sentence>They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise ineconomic growth in industrial countries.</sentence>
		<sentence>At the same time, thedecline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slowthis year.</sentence>
		<sentence>West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewedadvances in domestic consumption and investment spending, bothof which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetarypolicy, the institute said.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, it said the labour market would see only a slightimprovement because companies will be reluctant to hireadditional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly byagreed reductions in working hours.</sentence>
		<sentence>The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance ofmonetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a markedacceleration of inflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>It also warned that what it called the worldwidesynchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a newglobal recession.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said central banks in industrializedcountries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the FederalReserve Board's expansionary course.</sentence>
		<sentence>The institute said this in turn was bound to leadeventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.Policy towards a more restrictive policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other central bankswere likely to follow suit, causing a recession that couldaggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well asincrease protectionism around the world.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from thenegative effects of the global synchronization of monetarypolicy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces ofgrowth at home.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS</subject>
		<sentence>Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost itseconomy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washingtonto take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remainingrestrictions two weeks ago.</sentence>
		<sentence>Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdownof the figure, saying it takes into account a number ofhypothetical losses.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some of them are "too sophisticated toconvert into financial terms," one banking source said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions isimpossible to calculate.</sentence>
		<sentence>They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland'seconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-achieving.</sentence>
		<sentence>They did have a bad effect, yes, but they onlycontributed to largely internal, economic problems," one said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Imposed the measures and withdrew Most FavouredNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliationfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union undermartial law.</sentence>
		<sentence>The estimated cost to the Polish economy wasoriginally devised several years ago by the Institute ofNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planningcommission.</sentence>
		<sentence>According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polisheconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growthtrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases incredits from Western commercial and government lenders.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the calculations were based on a time when trade wasbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissingthe estimate as "a theoretical projection based on a high point,which has no real scientific evaluation."</sentence>
		<sentence>A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports tothe U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrsannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions wereimposed.</sentence>
		<sentence>Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to200 mln, as credits ran out.</sentence>
		<sentence>Poland has a dwindling tradesurplus with the West.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year it was one billion dlrsagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.</sentence>
		<sentence>Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland importantU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say creditsdried up for economic not political reasons.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Poland isaccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate forpolitical reasons," said one expert.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's an illusion based on amisunderstanding of Western economy."</sentence>
		<sentence>"There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someonewho has no hope of repaying it," another said, adding thatPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy creditsin the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.</sentence>
		<sentence>Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as "nebulous," onediplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical ordersand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing ofscientific links and exchanges.</sentence>
		<sentence>Western officials say thelifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impacton Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrsand lacks the means to modernise its industry.</sentence>
		<sentence>"MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will notbe treated worse than other countries.</sentence>
		<sentence>It will be difficult toregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces arein play now," said one Western envoy.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Polish products were not competitive, and theirquality was too low.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade wars and possible protectionistmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamperPoland's efforts to regain entry.</sentence>
		<sentence>Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognisedthis fact recently.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, "Makingup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonlydifficult, and in certain cases impossible...</sentence>
		<sentence>In a period oftwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level ofexports by only about 100 mln dlrs."</sentence>
		<sentence>While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says ithas a "moral right" to assistance from the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Which it saysimposed the sanctions illegally.</sentence>
		<sentence>But a Western economist said"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoingof the Polish economy won't cut any ice.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Americans willjust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushingSolidarity."</sentence>
		<sentence>Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, intalks in Washington last week with the International MonetaryFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland waslooking for a lead from the United States.</sentence>
		<sentence>He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet itsfinancial obligations to the United States, "but not in a shorttime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of itsforeign economic partners."</sentence>
		<sentence>He stressed that the U.S. "had a particular opportunity toplay a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partnersinterested in the settlement of Polish debt."</sentence>
		<sentence>Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamedWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF andParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years andsaid it should now play a more positive role.</sentence>
		<sentence>"As a major superpower the United States can influenceinternational organisations," he said, citing recent meetingsaimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent towhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.</sentence>

		<sentence>OPEC crude oil output in the first fewdays of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpdceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.</sentence>
		<sentence>The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oiltraders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the MiddleEast, Africa, Latin America and Asia.</sentence>
		<sentence>They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that thegroup is producing within its ceiling to support the return toa fixed price system, which came into effect last month.</sentence>
		<sentence>OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpdabove the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by theUnited Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.</sentence>
		<sentence>The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,was also producing above quota in the first days of March, thesurvey reveals.</sentence>
		<sentence>But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fallin Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability toexport as much as its quota allows.</sentence>
		<sentence>Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.</sentence>
		<sentence>Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,against a 4.133 mln bpd quota.</sentence>

		<sentence>Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, wasestimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 inearly March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its shareof Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by someOPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,both substantially under quota in February and early March.</sentence>
		<sentence>Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.</sentence>
		<sentence>Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"sprices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for anyshortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.</sentence>
