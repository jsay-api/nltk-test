		<subject>U.S. ECONOMIC DATA KEY TO DEBT FUTURES OUTLOOK</subject>
		<sentence>U.S. economic data this week could bethe key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures breakout of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although market expectations are for February U.S. retailsales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthygains, figures within or slightly below expectations would bepositive for the market, the analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bondsright now," said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst CraigSloane.</sentence>
		<sentence>Treasury bond futures came under pressure today whichtraders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and arise in oil prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, when sufficient selling interestto break below chart support in the June contract failed tomaterialize, participants who had sold bond futures earlyquickly covered short positions, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come inas expected it won't be that bad for the market," Sloane said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sectorof retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figurebelow market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, andshe put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up0.8 to 1.2 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Industrial production and the producer price index Fridayboth are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, sheadded.</sentence>
		<sentence>Retail sales "will tell us whether or not we will be ableto fill the gap," Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in Junebonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence>June bondsclosed at 100-4/32 today.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to thefederal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, saidCarroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.</sentence>
		<sentence>"A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded themarket from breaking out of the trading range the last time themarket approached the top of the range," Singer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,which is just below 102 in the June contract, "the crude oilrally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,"Singer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Fed funds are already easing back down toward thesix pct level."</sentence>
		<sentence>The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern toManufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rallymay be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract toease to 99-6/32 and find support.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.</sentence>

		<sentence>He said in a statement, "The idea with the foreign banks isto obtain from them the best terms to give the Ecuadoreaneconomy a complete relief in the period of deferral of paymentson the foreign debt during the present year."</sentence>
		<sentence>The statement referred only to payments due to privateforeign banks, a senior government finance official toldReuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>These creditors hold two-thirds of Ecuador's foreign debtwhich totals 8.16 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>It did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governmentsand multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainderof Ecuador's foreign debt, the official said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Cordovez said Ecuador would seek new loans frommultilateral organisations.</sentence>

		<sentence>Before the tremor, Ecuador suspendedinterest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials said they stopped interest payments due to acash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices,which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs.</sentence>

		<sentence>Cordovez also said in the statement, "The banks shouldperceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply withwhat was forseen."</sentence>

		<sentence>International efforts to redirect Japan'sexport-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavygoing if the country's largest defence contractor and world'sbiggest shipbuilder is anything to go by.</sentence>
		<sentence>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T> (MHI), which beganmaking ships and iron goods for Japan's military rulers 130years ago, is responding to the strong yen by redoubling itsefforts to maintain its share of export markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products,everyone will buy them," MHI president Yotaro Iida said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although two of MHI's main businesses, shipbuilding andpower plant construction, have been hit hard by the yen's 40pct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans toabandon them, Iida told Reuters in an interview.</sentence>
		<sentence>Its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, hasperformed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the moneyTokyo spends on defence procurement each year.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We have made the utmost efforts among the world'smanufacturers to improve productivity," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"You may besurprised if you come to see our plants.</sentence>
		<sentence>The outside is old butthe inside is ultra-modern, with robots and computers."</sentence>
		<sentence>Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed thatMHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors.</sentence>
		<sentence>Thecompany has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in1976.</sentence>
		<sentence>Despite its cost-cutting, MHI expects profits to drop 40pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March31, from 1985/86's record 50.14 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>And that includes gains from the sale of MHI's stake inMitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> for 49 billion yen.</sentence>
		<sentence>Iida is optimistic about the future, however.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said aresurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recentrecovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for powerplants in developing countries will help MHI restore itsexports-to-sales ratio to the past decade's average of 30 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>MHI's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in thehalf-year ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five yearsago.</sentence>
		<sentence>China is the most promising market, although MHI alsoconsiders other non-oil-producing developing countries as majorcustomers.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to alack of foreign currency," Iida said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he added that he feltMHI could sell to those markets with Japanese governmentfinancial support.</sentence>
		<sentence>It can also finance the plants itself and recover itsinvestment through product sales, a strategy Iida said couldprove popular in the future.</sentence>
		<sentence>In shipping, MHI is fighting back against low-priced SouthKorean competition by building more technologically advancedcarriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other productsdifficult to transport.</sentence>
		<sentence>Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is theworld's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity.</sentence>
		<sentence>Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects,including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launchvehicles for man-made satellites.</sentence>
		<sentence>It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan DefenceAgency's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles, although allof these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms.</sentence>
		<sentence>MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking todevelop the country's own fighter plane to replace thecurrently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s.</sentence>
		<sentence>Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressureon Tokyo to buy a U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas CorpF-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16, to reduce Japan's hugetrade surplus with the U.S.    "It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S.Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella," Iidasaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>In its StrategicDefence Initiative space defence program by participating inthe project when it moves from the research stage, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S. Has been seeking Japan's technological support.</sentence>
		<sentence>In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI'ssales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Iida saidthe ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and specialvehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shiftthe domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold tomanufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined tospecify which products.</sentence>

		<sentence>Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in partreflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the bank nearlytrebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other results released so far show <Saudi American Bank>(SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7mln riyals, while <Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as SaudiFrench, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.</sentence>
		<sentence>Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's <CCI.N>Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez,increased provisions sharply.</sentence>
		<sentence><Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mlnriyals.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non-performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in theSaudi economy bottoms out.</sentence>
		<sentence>Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economicactivity, but one banker said "The top 50 pct of the Saudi banksare now at or close to international levels on provisions."</sentence>
		<sentence>From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank <NationalCommercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals inprovisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to theprivate sector, bankers calculated.</sentence>
		<sentence>Between 1982 and 1985, <Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as thesecond biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, hadcovered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances.</sentence>
		<sentence>Both banks operateon an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has beentightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule fordeclaring loans as non-performing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figuresdifficult because some banks still book non-accruing interestas revenue while others follow more conservative practices inforce in major world financial centres.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and thejoint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rankas the strongest earners.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other banks such as <Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned bythe <British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by arelatively low deposit base.</sentence>
		<sentence>Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mlnriyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show anotherlow figure.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the bank has traditionally been one of the mostconservative in making provisions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see aSaudi bank go under and not only supported <Saudi Cairo Bank>after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also madeavailable cheap deposits to <Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB.</sentence>
		<sentence>The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, butgenerally banks are awash with liquidity since they areunwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>And while banks in more liberal financial markets canattempt to diversify away from traditional lending,conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generatefee income from new investment banking products.</sentence>
		<sentence>One banker said "Operating earnings in the Kingdom are notgood."</sentence>
		<sentence>Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount ofadvances is showing a declining trend, while the days whenbanks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts toinvest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better returnon their money.</sentence>
		<sentence>In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to currentaccounts was 27 to 73 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Today, only about 40 pct of customerfunds are held on current account.</sentence>

		<subject>INDONESIA PRESSING FOR COMPROMISE OVER COFFEE</subject>
		<sentence>Indonesian coffee exporters arepreparing for a period of depressed prices while urging theirgovernment to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue ofexport quotas, the chairman of the Association of IndonesianCoffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia,the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs andimproving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, wecan never bridge the gap," Dharyono said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries,along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed anew quota system at last month's failed International CoffeeOrganistion (ICO) talks in London.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under theGroup of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal.</sentence>
		<sentence>AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contactswith Brazil to suggest a compromise.</sentence>
		<sentence>Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICOnegotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eightwere in contact with Colombia, the world's second largestproducer, but gave no details.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from acompromise.</sentence>
		<sentence>Without one, they will suffer if the present marketstays like it is," Muda said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as theU.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead ofan ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S.And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and pressthem to present Indonesia's case more firmly.</sentence>
		<sentence>He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help thecountry's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations.</sentence>
		<sentence>Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground withthe big consumers because they agreed on the need for basingquotas on what he termed "realistic criteria."</sentence>
		<sentence>The breakaway group believes the old quota system, whichgives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does notreflect up-to-date supply and demand trends.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the oldsystem be applied.</sentence>
		<sentence>Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when marketprices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although prices have long since come down to a point whereexport controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumersat the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on newguidelines.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are bothrefusing to alter their positions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believedIndonesia was well placed to survive low prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and theAICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30,is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's levelof 360,000 tonnes, he said.</sentence>

		<subject>TAIWAN CLAMPS NEW CONTROLS ON CURRENCY INFLOWS</subject>
		<sentence>Taiwan's new controls on currencyinflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a floodof speculative money prompted by the local currency surgeagainst the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding onemln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance andbank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from anyother source.</sentence>
		<sentence>Petitioners have to show their remittances relate togenuine commercial transactions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report alloutward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight,insurance and royalties, to the central bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>But bankers said they believed the new controls would beineffective since businessmen could split up remittances intosmaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan'sflourishing currency black market.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are apanic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over thepast week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar toslow the growth of Taiwan's exports to the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government has denied local press reports Washington ispressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't think the central bank has a final target," said anexecutive with a U.S. Bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other bankers and economists saidthey are wary of making any firm predictions about how far theTaiwan dollar will rise.</sentence>
		<sentence>Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S.Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>The surpluswidened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billiondlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculativemoney flowed into Taiwan in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to morethan 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time lastyear and provided further upward pressure on the currency.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct againstthe U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouragingspeculators.</sentence>
		<sentence>Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last weekWashington's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reservesmeant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to thecurrency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allowthe local dollar to find its own level.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but thecentral bank is not prepared to do it.</sentence>
		<sentence>It simply does not wantto take the risk," said one local banker.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporarymeasure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples withthe exchange rate problem.</sentence>
		<sentence>The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirtaround the real issue, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreignexchange controls, said an executive with a western bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bankcharges will not outweigh the profits of speculation," said themanager of a European bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists criticised the controls, saying they couldantagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economicliberalisation in Taiwan.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Instead of liberalising outflows, the government hasrestricted inflows," said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickersda Costa.</sentence>
		<sentence>A local banker, who declined to be named, said, "It'sbasically ridiculous.</sentence>
		<sentence>It's a backward movement and goes againstthe government's liberalisation programme."</sentence>
		<sentence>Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations toenable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds,treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allowindividuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the countryeach year.</sentence>

		<subject>AUSTRALIA EXPECTS RISE IN MEAT EXPORTS TO MIDEAST</subject>
		<sentence>Australia expects meat and livestockexports to the Middle East to maintain an upward trend thisyear, managing director of the Australian Meat and LivestockCorp, Peter Frawley, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He told Reuters an improvement in the economic climate andless competition from the European Community should lead in theGulf area to higher beef sales, which dropped from 33,000tonnes in 1980 to just 2,300 tonnes last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In the last three to four months there has been aresurgence of inquiries," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Frawley is on a Gulf tour which will also take him to SaudiArabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to assess marketpotential.</sentence>
		<sentence>On beef exports, he said a 50 pct drop in EuropeanCommunity intervention stock in the past 12 months would helpAustralian sales.</sentence>
		<sentence>The fall meant the EC was not as aggressive in thesemarkets, where the Australian trade was the natural source ofsupply, and Australia was "now back in," Frawley said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said there was a debate in Australia as to whether theMiddle East market for livestock, which accounts for two-thirdsof meat export value to the area, would be maintained.</sentence>
		<sentence>He believed the trade would remain with a continuing demandfor fresh meat.</sentence>
		<sentence>The number of live sheep shipped last year to Saudi Arabia,the biggest single market, was 3,214,159 compared with2,939,226 in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>The numbers shipped to the United ArabEmirates and Bahrain fell, however.</sentence>
		<sentence>Frawley said the slackening in demand in the Gulf had beenoffset by other Arab countries around the Mediterranean.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other than livestock, Australia's overall meat sales to theMiddle East rose to 72,374 tonnes in 1986 from 52,403 tonnesthe previous year, largely due to the sale of 25,790 tonnes ofmutton and lamb to Iran.</sentence>
		<sentence>Australia sold 9,824 tonnes to Iran in 1985 after beingvirtually excluded by New Zealand competition for severalyears.</sentence>
		<sentence>Frawley said the 1986 sale contract had included abarter provision, but Iran had paid in full in cash.</sentence>
		<sentence>Negotiations with the Iranians for 1987 shipments werecurrently under way, with Iran again seeking credit and barterprovisions, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Frawley said there had been a tremendous growth in demandfor chilled lamb in the last four to five years and hepredicted this would continue.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Middle East, and the Gulf in particular, is nowAustralia's largest market for lamb, chilled and flown in.</sentence>

		<sentence>Ecuador, stricken by a severe earthquake,is seeking through negotiations with private foreign banks topostpone all payments due to them for the rest of the year,Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said in a statement, "The idea with the foreign banks isto obtain from them the best terms to give the Ecuadoreaneconomy a complete relief in the period of deferral of paymentson the foreign debt during the present year."</sentence>
		<sentence>The statement referred only to payments due to privateforeign banks, a senior government finance official toldReuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>These creditors hold two-thirds of Ecuador's foreign debtwhich totals 8.16 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>It did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governmentsand multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainderof Ecuador's foreign debt, the official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Ecuador owed the private foreign banks between 450and 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of 1987 andabout 66 mln in principal payments maturing this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cordovez said Ecuador would seek new loans frommultilateral organisations.</sentence>
		<sentence>A World Bank mission was due heresoon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ecuador has also appealed for emergency aid from about 40foreign governments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Government officials have calculated losses to the 1987budget from last Thursday's earthquake at 926 mln dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>In 1986, Ecuador's total service on the foreign debt wasabout 996 mln dlrs to all creditors.</sentence>
		<sentence>The quake ruptured Ecuador's main oil pipeline, suspendingcrude exports for five months until the line is repaired.</sentence>
		<sentence>Oilaccounts for up to two-thirds of its total exports and up to 60pct of total revenues.</sentence>
		<sentence>Before the tremor, Ecuador suspendedinterest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials said they stopped interest payments due to acash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices,which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contactevery day this week with some of the banks who sit on its14-bank advisory committee, the senior government financeofficial said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The committee represents the country's 400 or soprivate foreign bank creditors.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cordovez also said in the statement, "The banks shouldperceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply withwhat was forseen."</sentence>
		<sentence>Cordovez added, Ecuador must make a new proposal in linewith the reality since the earthquake by seeking better optionsof deferment and of softening the negotiation conditions."</sentence>
		<sentence>Interest payments fall due at least monthly to privateforeign banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ecuador's initial proposal earlier this year was to makeonly one semi-annual or one annual interest payment this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under this proposal, it sought to defer interest paymentsuntil June at the earliest, foreign bankers and governmentofficials here said.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - PARIS BOURSE REFORM</subject>
		<sentence>French stockbrokers will lose theirjealously guarded 180-year-old monopoly of share trading overthe next five years under reforms announced on Tuesday byFinance Minister Edouard Balladur.</sentence>
		<sentence>But with the prospect of fresh money flooding into theirseriously under-capitalised share trading business, there werefew signs of regret over the gradual passing of an era.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It is a question of survival after London's Big Bang," saidprivate market analyst Edouard Cointreau.</sentence>
		<sentence>Balladur said the long-expected reform of the Boursestructure will progressively allow domestic and foreign banksto buy stakes in stockbrokers' capital, while at the same timebrokers will be allowed access to the money markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>The project foresees free access to the Bourse by January1, 1992, the date set for the opening of a unified Europeanfinancial market.</sentence>
		<sentence>The planned reform, expected to be put before Parliamentbefore the end of the Spring session, will open up the capitalof the 45 Paris and 15 regional stockbroker houses in threestages beginning on January 1 next year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The aim of the move, following the examples of Tokyo andLondon in opening up their tightly-controlled membership, was"to take up the challenge of European financial integration andfierce international competition," Balladur announced.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cointreau, founder and chairman of the private marketanalysis company Centre d'Observation et de ProspectiveSociales (COPS), said the reform was a natural development.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Paris market is rising but that cannot go on for ever.</sentence>
		<sentence>The brokers know it's a good time to sell part of theirbusiness," he told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>The reform was inevitable given the European Communitydirective, said Ben Williams of Paris brokerage houseFauchier-Magnan.</sentence>
		<sentence>"From a French point of view one cannot be verydisappointed," he said, "but some brokers must be a bit worriedas it is not entirely evident that all brokerage houses areworth a lot of money."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said that with the expansion of the market generallyhere quality brokerage staff would do very well out of thereforms in salary terms.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But on the whole expertise is not verydeep and the banks already have a lot of such expertise."</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers agreed generally that by allowing brokers toreinforce their equity capital, the reform was expected toimprove their ability to take large positions in stocks andbolster the liquidity of the Paris market.</sentence>
		<sentence>The French Banking Association, grouping domestic andforeign banks operating here, welcomed the reforms.</sentence>
		<sentence>Frenchbanks, which only won direct access to the bond markets lastSeptember, have never been happy with the stockbrokers'continuing monopoly on share trading.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brokers said it was too soon to say what form links withother foreign brokerage houses and banks might take.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Nobody iswilling to talk about this yet but one can be sure thatalliances have been formed over the past years," Williams said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some brokers said the opening up of their capital to bankscould pose questions such as whether the major banks might allaim for stakes in the most prestigious and best-performingbrokerage houses, or whether the smaller houses might betargetted for swallowing up to give banks an easy entry ontothe Bourse.</sentence>
		<sentence>Individual banks were reticent over likely strategy withtheir future partners.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Discussions will get underway soon butno specific choice (of broker) has been made yet," a spokesmanfor Credit Lyonnais who declined to be named said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Balladur's project does not touch on dealing commissionsbut many dealers said the question had to be addressed sincecurrent bank commission was higher than that of brokers becausebanks, who cannot deal directly in shares, have to pay a fee tothe broker they use for customer trading.</sentence>
		<sentence>According to a study by the Bourse official watchdog bodyCOB in January, dealing fees on a transaction in shares for agross total of 1,000 francs were 14.86 pct if the order wasplaced directly by a broker, against 20.79 pct for the sameorder passed through a bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>Xavier Dupont, Chairman of the Stockbrokers' Association,said the reform would not mean an end to the fixed scale ofcommissions.</sentence>

		<sentence>The countries' effortsto further economic growth and to consolidate budgets were "notunsuccessful."</sentence>

		<sentence>The region's 1986 trade surplus was halved to an estimated15 billion dlrs, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The cut in exchange earnings of oilexporting countries was only partly offset by the advantagesgained by the region's oil importing states, he noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>The region's principal debtors are Brazil and Mexico, eachowing about 100 billion dlrs at the end of last year, followedby Argentina with around 49 billion dlrs, Venezuela with 33billion and Chile with 20 billion dlrs debt.</sentence>

		<sentence>Domestically, the economy may get a boost from someloosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said HaruoMuto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.</sentence>
		<sentence>The next reading of the economy's health should come earlynext week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct fromthe previous quarter.</sentence>
		<sentence>In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>But a senior government official said the fourth quarterfigures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one pointquarter-on-quarter.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he added that would be a statisticalaberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.</sentence>
		<sentence>To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, theeconomy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourthquarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.</sentence>
		<sentence>The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably astatistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of1986, the official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists said the fourth quarter figures were alsodistorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the secondhalf of 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>Because the coins were classified as legal tender, theirpurchase did not show up in the statistics on consumerexpenditure.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumer spending also tailed off in Decemberbecause of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-yearbonuses, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>As the government had to buy back some of the coins fromretailers because they were unsold, the government'scontribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have beenboosted, economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Taketomi said it may have received a further boost fromgovernment buying of farm products as the domestic crop lastyear was good.</sentence>
		<sentence>The senior government official said the fourth quarterperformance of the domestic sector was probably worse thangenerally expected, while that of the external sector wasbetter.</sentence>

		<subject>MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS</subject>
		<sentence>Most Japanese companies have decided notto renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spotprices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels,industry sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubaitraded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to itsofficial price of 17.42 dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract forIranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting atotal of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crudeunder term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift inthe second quarter.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discountson cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discountsdepended largely on the levels of spot prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we wouldprobably buy Iranian crude at the official price," one Japaneserefiner said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We don't intend to put pressure on them," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oilat official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades areconsiderably lower, oil traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said if spot prices move higher there will be noproblem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil afterfinding no buyers at official prices in March.</sentence>
		<sentence>The problem islikely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus.</sentence>
		<sentence>The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself fromOPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to thefixed prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close toits first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demandwould be balanced by the end of the second quarter.</sentence>
		<sentence>They also said if OPEC holds its official price structurebased on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuationsshould be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai anda 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.</sentence>

		<sentence>He projected a capital expenditurebudget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mlndlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration andproduction, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silassaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Phillips' top priority in 1987 will be to get thewaterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields toimprove our ability to extract oil and increase earnings," Silassaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected tocost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln grossbarrels of oil over a period of 24 years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silassaid he was seeking "a modification of terms with the Chinesegovernment to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijangfields) commercially viable."</sentence>
		<sentence>In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the PointArguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Weexpect to start up the first platform then," Silas said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced thecompany to part with several oil and gas assets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K.North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that isnow completed, Silas said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We sold high cost producing assets.</sentence>
		<sentence>They were not goodvalue for us but possibly so for someone else," Silas said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earningsfor the company.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and weare using that to manage our debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Even the asset sales, whileregrettable, were necessary to reduce debt," Silas said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oilprices don't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels  forseveral months.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Then, everyone would be looking at sales (ofassets), and we're no different from the others," Silas said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings fromPhillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs inearnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This was our second best year pushed by a good supply anddemand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costsfor our operations," Silas said, "In 1987 we think the market'ssupply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstockand energy costs will rise due to price recovery."</sentence>

		<sentence>British Telecommunications Plc's <BTY.L>profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced byincreasing competition and continued costs for replacing oldtelephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter resultswhich were released earlier today, Odgers said the companyfaced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systemsin Britain for three to five years.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said <Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and WirelessPlc <CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.</sentence>
		<sentence>Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into someof British Telecom's most profitable areas.</sentence>
		<sentence>One company official privately estimated that BritishTelecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunicationsmarket but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, whichlead to some disruption in service, could well have encouragedclients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, he forecast that the last quarter's resultsoverall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.</sentence>
		<sentence>He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls shouldbe limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.</sentence>
		<sentence>But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength,economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growthindustry will help produce annual profit increases for theforseeable future.</sentence>
		<sentence>British Telecom will also seek to expand intomanufacturing, he said, adding that research and developmentexpenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared withthe current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helpedshares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday'sclose and off an early high of 248p.</sentence>

		<subject>NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED</subject>
		<sentence>The Brazilian Coffee Institute,IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until theend of next week at the earliest, trade sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting governmentministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assessBrazil's position in the light of the failure of talks inLondon earlier this month to set new International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, export quotas.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethinkits position completely," one Santos exporter said.</sentence>
		<sentence>A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set forThursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explainhis plan to members then before announcing any new measures.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dauster told reporters on his return from London last weekthat no decisions would be made on exports before he had heldtalks with all sectors of the industry.</sentence>
		<sentence>Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure tostart marketing coffee immediately.</sentence>
		<sentence>World prices have beenrecovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICOtalks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilosfor export in the first four months of this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The exporters said the key factor in the eventual openingof May and June export registrations will be the amount atwhich the contribution quota is set.</sentence>
		<sentence>With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanismssuch as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees beingintroduced, the level of the quota will be decisive indetermining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on worldmarkets, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>They noted that on February 16, the eve of a plannedincrease in the quota, April registrations were opened andclosed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a recordamount for a single day.</sentence>
		<sentence>If May/June registrations are opened under similarconditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty inselling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The problem would be how to limit sales," one exporter said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems meanthere are pressures from the government to boost exports tomaximise foreign exchange earnings.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt amarketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominantposition as an exporter, but without causing a price war.</sentence>
		<sentence>General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would planto export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO.</sentence>
		<sentence>The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be aroundthe figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas werereintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired withthe breakdown of talks.</sentence>
		<sentence>With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags thisyear, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags aftermeeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even toconsider exporting such quantities, as this would almostinevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried toencroach on other producers' markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderlymarketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil'smarket share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mlnbags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordialrelations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stanceat the ICO talks, they added.</sentence>

		<sentence>Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to theEuropean Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC(Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reducedby 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS</subject>
		<sentence>U.S. retail sales rose sharply inFebruary but many economists said the underlying consumerspending trend remains weak.</sentence>
		<sentence>February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0pct rise the financial markets had anticipated.</sentence>
		<sentence>But January'ssales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previouslyreported 5.8 pct decline.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at amuch more sluggish pace," said Don Maude of Midland MontaguCapital Markets Inc.    Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales dataover past four months to show that the pace of consumerspending is slowing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in Novemberand a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gainover the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4pct rise for year-over-year sales through February.</sentence>
		<sentence>"You can see a pattern developing," Maude said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I wouldn'tbe surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since salesprobably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were inFebruary."</sentence>
		<sentence>Despite the weak underlying trend, economists wereimpressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excludingautos in February.</sentence>
		<sentence>This compared to a revised 0.4 pct declinein January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gainsin durable goods as well as non-durables," noted Ward McCarthyof Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. "It was a pretty healthyreport."</sentence>
		<sentence>He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in Februaryafter falling 1.7 pct in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>General merchandise storesales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There are signs of life in the economy," McCarthy said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this reportinto the future."</sentence>
		<sentence>A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in Januarywhich may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boostspending in February, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholdingtaxes from their paychecks," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"When people in thiscountry get an increase in disposable income, the inclinationis to go out and spend it," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales forthe first 10 days of March will be an important indicator ofhow much this sector will add to first quarter spending.</sentence>
		<sentence>Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of totalFebruary sales, rising 14.4 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>This followed a 27.7 pct dropin January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largelyto the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax lawsJanuary 1, the Commerce Department noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some economists argued that the because the gain in totalsales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, thestrength in the February report is less than impressive.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There is strength in the February data, but that's becausethey were compared to low sales levels in January," said saidBeth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "We don't see it as aprecursor of continued strength."</sentence>
		<sentence>Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling17.7 pct in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>February non-durable goods sales gained1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higheroil prices rather than an increased volume of gas salesprobably accounted for these gains.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spendingis weakening.</sentence>
		<sentence>Total retail sales on average were 123 billiondlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In January, theyfell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and inFebruary rose to 122.29 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>"On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mlndlrs in the first quartrer," she said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We don't look at thisas indication that the economy is barrelling along."</sentence>
		<sentence>"The number is not really that problematic for those of uswho are constructive on the bond market," agreed Elliot Plattof Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.    Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetarypolicy on the basis of the latest retail sales report.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Fed is on hold now because the data have been soconfusing," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payrollemployment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut inMarch," he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>The National Wildlife Federation rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wildernesslands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration.</sentence>
		<sentence>The federation, the nation's largest conservation group,said further study was needed to assess any possible damagethat development might have on the wildlife in the area, thecoastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, calledthe Interior's research into the effects of development "sofundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis onwhich to make a public policy decision."</sentence>
		<sentence>Hair called the department's proposal a "reflection of alargely political decision," adding "we have no confidence inInterior to represent the broad public interest in this area."</sentence>
		<sentence>Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plainto oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said a preliminary survey showed the region could holdbillions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential asan energy resource would never be known without exploration.</sentence>
		<sentence>Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gasexploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain awildlife refuge protected from commercial development.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hair said Interior's report failed to stress theprobability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas,fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gatherednor had the department consulted the Environmental ProtectionAgency on the possible effects of exploration.</sentence>
		<sentence>The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that anine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of theissue and report back to Congress in about two years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possibleexploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate tomake a sound judgement.</sentence>

		<sentence>The FRN market has been suffering from acute contraction ofliquidity and consequent drain of investor confidence since theeffective collapse in the market for perpetual floating rateissues late last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since then, FRN specialists noted that retail interest hasbeen sparse or completely absent and the stagnant market forfloating rate paper has become increasingly vulnerable tomanipulation, with nerves affecting all variety of borrowers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Floating rate debt of U.S. And Canadian banks came underpressure last month when fears resurfaced about their exposureto Latin American debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Canadian banks were hard hit today.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fears about the Irish economy, exacerbated by recentpost-electoral political wrangling in Dublin, prompted asell-off of Ireland paper this morning with both dollar andmark-denominated Irish issues tumbling by a full point or more.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, FRN dealers polled by Reuters felt the Irishissues had been singled out -- as the U.S. And Canadian bankswere most recently -- as the market's most vulnerable sector.</sentence>
		<sentence>"A handful of professional houses are targetting the weakpaper, shorting it aggressively and this is just starting thedomino effect with basically sound paper also starting to rollwith it," a senior FRN market source explained.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although floating paper from better-regarded borrowers suchas the U.K.</sentence>
		<sentence>Managed to finish the day only around 10 basispoints down, other sovereigns like Sweden and supranationalslike Eurofima suffered heavier losses, FRN dealers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Debt exposure fears continued to undermine U.S. AndCanadian bank paper with one U.K. House citing a fall of 1-5/8point on the day on a Royal Bank of Canada issue.</sentence>

		<sentence>There has been slight progress towardsreaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nationsconference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement,INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There has been some slight progress but it is not the endof the road yet," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the lasteffort to adopt an accord to replace the current one whichexpires in October.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some 40 producing and consuming countriesare taking part in the two-week meeting.</sentence>
		<sentence>Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved bytomorrow he would hold weekend meetings.</sentence>
		<sentence>At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meetingin nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settlethose issues this week so that technical drafting work can bedone next week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Conference sources said it is highly unlikely thatproducers will accept a pact that will provide for any possibledownward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed byconsumers under certain circumstances.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said this means that any possible adjustmentwould centre on the reference price, and the "may buy" (or "maysell") and "must buy" (or "must sell") levels without changing the"lower indicative price" (or floor price) of 150Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact.</sentence>
		<sentence>The present five-day average of the indicator price isaround 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price,set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents akilo, and of the "lower indicative price" if the buffer stock,currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals insteadof the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism torespond automatically to market trends.</sentence>
		<sentence>At present, if the market price has been above or below thereference price for six months, the reference price is revisedby five pct or by an amount decided by the InternationalNatural Rubber Organisation council.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustmentbe automatic at five pct or more.</sentence>
		<sentence>Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council inthe price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern thatchanges proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact.</sentence>

		<sentence>A member of the board whichregulates the Farm Credit System predicted the troubled farmlender may lose about 900 mln dlrs in the first half of 1987,hastening the need for a federal rescue this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Speaking to the House subcommittee responsible for farmcredit issues, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) board memberJim Billington said "My recommendation is that legislation(aiding the system) must be moved prior to June, 30, 1987, orit will be difficult to close the (farm credit system) books."</sentence>
		<sentence>Billington's loss prediction is gloomier than either thesystem or its regulator had previously admitted.</sentence>
		<sentence>The system itself has so far predicted losses for all of1987 will reach only 1.1 billion dlrs, down from 1.9 billion in1986 and 2.7 billion in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Billington said the system is losing in excess of400 mln dlrs per quarter, implying total losses for 1987 ofmore than 1.6 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>Losses of that magnitude would exhaust the 1.4 billion dlrsin capital surplus the system held at the end of 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>The system also has 4.2 billion dlrs in capital held by itsmember borrowers, called borrower stock, which theoreticallycould be used as capital.</sentence>
		<sentence>Billington said by the end of 1987, more than 1.6 billiondlrs of the 4.2 billion in borrower stock would be downgradedin value because of the mounting losses.</sentence>
		<sentence>Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, urged thatCongress begin to consider legislation rescuing the system byEaster and that a bill be completed by the fall.</sentence>
		<sentence>Chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep. Ed Jones,(D-Tenn.) said today "the time has arrived to considerassistance to save the system."</sentence>
		<sentence>The Senate Democratic leadership indicated last month thatit would begin drafting a bailout bill by Easter.</sentence>
		<sentence>FCA board members differed on whether a direct governmentinfusion of cash will be needed to rescue the system.</sentence>
		<sentence>FCAchairman Naylor said a federal guarantee of both borrower stockand system bonds held by investors might avoid the need toprovide "hard capital" to the system.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. FARM CREDIT LOSS PUT AT 900 MLN IN 1ST HALF</subject>
		<sentence>A member of the board whichregulates the Farm Credit System predicted the troubled farmlender may lose about 900 mln dlrs in the first half of 1987,hastening the need for a federal rescue this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Speaking to the House subcommittee responsible for farmcredit issues, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) board memberJim Billington said "My recommendation is that legislation(aiding the system) must be moved prior to June, 30, 1987, orit will be difficult to close the (farm credit system) books."</sentence>
		<sentence>Billington's loss prediction is gloomier than either thesystem or its regulator had previously admitted.</sentence>
		<sentence>The system itself has so far predicted losses for all of1987 will reach only 1.1 billion dlrs, down from 1.9 billion in1986 and 2.7 billion in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Billington said the system is losing in excess of400 mln dlrs per quarter, implying total losses for 1987 ofmore than 1.6 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>Losses of that magnitude would exhaust the 1.4 billion dlrsin capital surplus the system held at the end of 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>The system also has 4.2 billion dlrs in capital held by itsmember borrowers, called borrower stock, which theoreticallycould be used as capital.</sentence>
		<sentence>Billington said by the end of 1987, more than 1.6 billiondlrs of the 4.2 billion in borrower stock would be downgradedin value because of the mounting losses.</sentence>
		<sentence>Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, urged thatCongress begin to consider legislation rescuing the system byEaster and that a bill be completed by the fall.</sentence>
		<sentence>Chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep. Ed Jones,(D-Tenn.) said today "the time has arrived to considerassistance to save the system."</sentence>
		<sentence>The Senate Democratic leadership indicated last month thatit would begin drafting a bailout bill by Easter.</sentence>
		<sentence>FCA board members differed on whether a direct governmentinfusion of cash will be needed to rescue the system.</sentence>
		<sentence>FCA chairman Naylor said a federal guarantee of bothborrower stock and system bonds held by investors might avoidthe need to provide "hard capital" to the system.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Billington said "its not really that simple, in myopinion," adding that government funds may be needed to rescuethe system.</sentence>

		<subject>PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP</subject>
		<sentence>Pessimism over the effects of aprolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop isrising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mlnbag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital ofSalvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, whichbroke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up ashoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in thefirst three months of the May/September crop.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said arrivals from May through July might onlyreach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected.</sentence>
		<sentence>Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as podsfrom current flowering are gathered.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the sources noteda late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, whichflourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is morelikely from late July on.</sentence>
		<sentence>This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor pricesmean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers andinsecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.</sentence>
		<sentence>A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremelyvulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0mln bag mark if the disease hits.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although flowering was good following the start of therains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly becausethe drought had caused a drop in the insect population whichpollinates flowers, the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels arenow generally back to near normal levels and that currentflowering and pod setting is good, which should result inmature fruit from August through September.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting ofbeans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of themain crop, which officially starts on October 1.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The cut-off date is completely artificial.</sentence>
		<sentence>If things gowell from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a breakfrom August through November or even December," one said.</sentence>
		<sentence>If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao proveaccurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for thepast 10 years.</sentence>
		<sentence>The last poor temporao was in 1984 whenprolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mlnbags, the lowest since 1974.</sentence>
		<sentence>Good growing conditions the following year produced atemporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bagrecord, while last year's output, which also suffered somedrought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.</sentence>
		<sentence>Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwardsby the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said large quantities of beans are believed tohave been undeclared from this year's record total harvest andthey were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by theend of the official crop year on April 30.</sentence>
		<sentence>Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by theinclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to portwarehouses but not declared.</sentence>
		<sentence>Because of the high turnover of beans this year,significant amounts have deteriorated because they were storedtoo long at the back of warehouses.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some of these are expectedto be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.</sentence>
		<sentence>With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao andmain crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeksstill to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should beat least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>This would compare with the previous record set last yearof 6.03 mln.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, there is no way of telling how many current cropbeans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporaoand thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never beofficially registered.</sentence>

		<subject>TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER CORP <PCC></subject>
		<sentence>Purolator Courier corp's stock rose onspecualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director wouldfind a new suitor for the company, traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members ofits Purolator courier division's management.</sentence>
		<sentence>The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one.</sentence>
		<sentence>Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resignedfrom its board of directors in a letter dated March 10.</sentence>
		<sentence>The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board becausethe merger agreement with Hutton barred directors fromsoliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get abetter deal.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gardner said he believes a better offer might befound if the company would agree to be sold to some otherentity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courierdivision.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has450 mln dlrs in revenues.</sentence>
		<sentence>It's a very large company and it'sbeing sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs," said Gardner in a telephoneinterview with Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firmassociated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelitycompanies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said hepersonally owns 20,000 shares.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Purolator official said the company has no comment on theletter from Gardner.</sentence>
		<sentence>Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger servicemay emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator.</sentence>
		<sentence>Before thetransaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had alsospeculated another courier company would be the most likelysuitor.</sentence>
		<sentence>While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be nonew bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushedthe stock into play again.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There's no shortage of possibilities.</sentence>
		<sentence>It's just a questionof management's willingness to let the process continue," saidone arbitrager.</sentence>
		<sentence>Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because theybelieve Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrscash per share.</sentence>
		<sentence>The balance of Purolator's stock will be boughtfor securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.courier operations.</sentence>
		<sentence>The arbitragers said tender offer documents show thatHutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction andwill emerge with a giant, majority equity interest inPurolator.</sentence>
		<sentence>"As far as I can tell from the public documents from thedeal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.</sentence>
		<sentence>One always likes a situation like that.</sentence>
		<sentence>You always like tothink if they can do this deal at no risk, there should besomeone else in the world that could do it higher," said onearbitrager.</sentence>
		<sentence>The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, andsources close to the transaction disputed the claim that thefirm will not end up paying for its equity position.</sentence>
		<sentence>While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer documentdid note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have tokeep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is somerisk to the firm.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,and all sorts of things that make it very speculative," saidone of the sources, adding there are also severance payments toemployees.</sentence>
		<sentence>The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrsin so-called "bridge" financing for the transaction.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bridgefinancing is a temporary loan from Hutton.</sentence>
		<sentence>The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,expected to come from banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, it may take some time toreplace the financing, the source said, resulting in what couldbe a substantial expense to the firm.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mlndlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transactionsaid fees are at the low end of the scale.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's a very complex transaction, but basically whathappens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recaptureany investment they might have once the merger takes place,"Gardner said.</sentence>

		<subject>GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN</subject>
		<sentence>Implementation of a one-year 0/92pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promotedtoday by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommitteeas a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmersanother option when making their planting decisions.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We have a budget driven farm policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>It may be a shame,but we are locked into this," said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.</sentence>
		<sentence>),chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt thefarmer.</sentence>
		<sentence>A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."</sentence>
		<sentence>Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 billfor 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains.</sentence>
		<sentence>An aide to Glickmansaid that it will probably be introduced next week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer toforego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiencypayment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided underthe current bill.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meetbudget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better thansharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.</sentence>
		<sentence>A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply adifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from governmentpayments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at thispoint, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't think there is any interest in pursuing adecoupling bill this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Period.</sentence>
		<sentence>Unequivocal," Glickman saidat the hearing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of theBoren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.</sentence>
		<sentence>Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hisplan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment toparticipating farmers, require that idled acreage be put toconservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extraidled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acresin a county and provide tenant protection provisions.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, butwe can at least move in that direction," Boschwitz said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testifiedin favor of decoupling.</sentence>
		<sentence>Decoupling would end the current biasin U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'dependency on the government, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnsonsaid, and would still encourage farmers to plant.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials from the National Corn Growers Association andthe National Cattlemen's Association said their groups opposeany 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening thefarm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.</sentence>
		<sentence>But when asked if his association were forced to choosebetween a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, LarryJohnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.</sentence>

		<sentence>The budget deficit, which is currently slated at 173billion dlrs for fiscal 1988, is supposed to be reduced to 108billion dlrs under the provisions of the Gramm-Rudman Act,which calls for a balanced budget by fiscal 1991.</sentence>
		<sentence>Miller said he believes the budget deficit can be reducedbut added, "the surest way to put us in a pickle" would be toraise or ease the Gramm-Rudman goal.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If we were to raise taxes so soon after tax reform, itwould create enormous uncertainty on the financial markets," hesaid, adding that giving up on the will to reduce the deficitwould also create uncertainty.</sentence>

		<subject>WHITE HOUSE DETAILS CREDIT REFORM LEGISLATION</subject>
		<sentence>The Reagan Administration sent toCongress proposed legislation that would require Congress toreflect the cost of federal loan subsidies in the government'sbudget.</sentence>
		<sentence>The legislation would require Congress to approve allsubsidies on loans, to sell off many loans to the privatesector shortly after they are made and to buy privatereinsurance for many guaranteed loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>White House officials estimated reinsurance premiums  couldamount to six billion dlrs a year to private companies.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bill would make little impact on the federal deficit orpayroll, officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The legislation would not in itself alter the terms offederal credit programs.</sentence>
		<sentence>But officials said they would be pleased if Congresstightened some programs after seeing their true cost set out inthe budget.</sentence>
		<sentence>The program would call for the immediate sale of many newlymade direct federal loans, but would no effect existing federalloan portfolios.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some of these are already proposed to be soldoff under previous administration programs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Exempt from the sale requirement would be loans made underthe Commodity Credit Corp commodity loan program, which thegovernment considers to be a commodity purchase program ratherthan a credit program, and defaulted guaranteed loans, whichthe government considers to be the same as direct loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also excluded from the sale requirement would be mostforeign loans, though officials said they may at some pointconsider selling off some Export-Import Bank loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials said government loan programs currently amount toabout 252 billion dlrs in direct loans and 450 billion dlrs inguaranteed loans a year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials said U.S. agencies were asked to calculate theapproximate cost of their loan subsidies by looking atcomparable loans in the marketplace.</sentence>
		<sentence>The administration is asking Congress to begin reflectingthe cost of these subsidies in the fiscal 1988 budget, whichthe House Budget Committee plans to begin marking up late nextweek.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials said the reforms, if adopted across-the-board byall affected congressional committees, would lower the federaldeficit by only 100 mln dlrs in fiscal 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>Officials said the administration hopes to sell a total of13.0 billion dlrs in loan assets during fiscal 1988, including1.8 billion dlrs in loan assets under the credit reform programand 11.2 billion dlrs in loan assets already in thegovernemnt's portfolion.</sentence>
		<sentence>In fiscal 1989, the administration hopes to sell 8.9billion dlrs in loans, including 1.3 billion dlrs of loansunder the credit reform program and 7.6 billion dlrs from theexisting portfolio.</sentence>

		<sentence>Outlining terms of the plan circulated to the lendersearlier this week, the company said it is seeking approval inprinciple for the proposal "within the next several weeks" inorder to implement the debt rescheduling by June 30, 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Although at today's price levels it only allows the companyto struggle on, benefits appear as oil prices rise," Domechairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We believe the plan is a rational one, and will be validunder a range of circumstances," chairman Macdonald said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The lenders previously agreed to an interim debtrescheduling until June 30 to allow Dome time to negotiate along-term recapitalization.</sentence>
		<sentence>The debt proposal is designed to ensure continued existenceof the company, which would see lenders get maximum recovery oftheir loans, Dome said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The plan would maintain debt levels within Dome's abilityto pay, subject to minimum debt service levels for each lender.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome said the debt proposal offers measures such as equityconversion options and reclassification to lower interestbearing categories of debt to accomplish its objectives.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under certain circumstances, lenders will have the optionto convert all or part of their debt to common shares at apre-determined conversion rate upon plan implementation.</sentence>
		<sentence>The various conversion rates remain to be set throughnegotiations, and the company said it is impossible to predictthe extent to which the conversion option will be exercised andthe amount of dilution that may result.</sentence>
		<sentence>Converting debt to common shares after the plan isimplemented would be at a much higher conversion price, Domesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Common shareholders will be asked to approve the planbefore it is put in place.</sentence>
		<sentence>Debt that remains after share conversion will eitherreceive scheduled payments based on contract interest rates anda 15 to 20 year pay-out, or interest rates indexed to oilprices.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company will use both an annual security-to-debtratio test and a monthly cash flow test to classify whichinterest payments are paid on the different portions of debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>To achieve a stable operating base for the company, theplan provides for deducting operating costs, capitalexpenditures and general and administrative expenses before theremaining available cash flow is distributed to lenders, Domesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>The proposal also assumes efforts will continue to operatethe business as efficiently as possible, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>As the company previously said, debt payments from cashflow be divided into two broad categories, secured andunsecured creditors.</sentence>
		<sentence>Terms of the debt plan include paying institutionalunsecured creditors, comprising mostly banks who hold privatedebt, from cash flow generated by unpledged assets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Thisportion will get a fixed low interest rate under a 15-yearrepayment schedule.</sentence>
		<sentence>Remaining institutional unsecured debt will get paidthrough convertible, oil indexed unsecured debt that matures in20 years, or any available excess cash flow, or conversion toequity.</sentence>
		<sentence>Any institutional lender also has the option of takingall or part of its debt in common shares.</sentence>
		<sentence>To offer public unsecured debtholders liquidity, Dome saidthey can also convert all or part of their debt to commonshares when the plan is implemented.</sentence>
		<sentence>Any debt leftover would beexchanged for a convertible debenture with an interest ratelinked to oil prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Secured creditors would get paid from cashflow generated bythe assets pledged against their debt under a complex formula,the company said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Any shortfalls under the formula could also be converted tooil-linked debentures.</sentence>

		<subject>BOLIVIA TO OFFER TO BUY BACK BANK DEBT</subject>
		<sentence>Bolivia is to make a formal offer duringthe next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt fromcommercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bankpresident Jier Nogales said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steeringcommittee of Bolivia's creditor banks had agreed to considerthe offer at a meeting in New York last month.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivianpaper on the international secondary debt market, where it nowtrades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy backits commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid thediscounted rate in full.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to30 years at interest rates below those fixed in theinternational markets, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loansto commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said therewould be no money available to restart traditional debtservicing to them for some time.</sentence>
		<sentence>Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes tocancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs,but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make aformal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt atdiscounted rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nogales said practical and strategic considerations woulddetermine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made inthe next few months.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks overthe price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would makea single non-negotiable offer.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendlycreditor countries, let alone commercial banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>The onlytraditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which wouldmean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater lossprovisions, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We are confident that the banks are going to bereasonable," Nogales said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Now they can resolve their problemsfor once and for all."</sentence>
		<sentence>"The most conservative ones who want a little more willwait a year, but I don't know if the window of opportunity willbe open all the time," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia's fourbillion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed togovernments and the rest to international agencies, Nogalessaid negotiators had achieved considerable success in recentdiscussions with the Paris Club.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to rescheduleBolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, whileaccepting that interest would not be paid until 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence>Interestrates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under ParisClub rules, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregardpenalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing withArgentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans frominternational agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400mln dlrs in disbursements this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changedfrom a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflowof 130 mln dlrs last year, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nogales said that Bolivia's net international reserves nowstood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs indisposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssorotook office in August, 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct ayear in the government's first month in office, was now down to10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and theplan was that it should continue at this level.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the government was also expecting at least threepct growth in gdp this year after several years of negativerates.</sentence>

		<sentence>The Securities and ExchangeCommission asked the New York Stock Exchange to tighten anexperimental procedure used in the past six months to dampenvolatility linked to the so-called "triple-witching hour."</sentence>
		<sentence>The Big Board has been collecting and publicizinginformation on large imbalances of "market-on-close" (MOC)orders placed on 50 major stocks one-half-hour before closingon so-called expiration Fridays in September and December.</sentence>
		<sentence>Expiration Fridays, or triple witching hours, occur everythree months when stock options, stock index options andfutures on index options expire simultaneously.</sentence>
		<sentence>As aribrageurs liquidated their futures and options onprevious expiration Fridays, they sold huge amounts of stockwhich they had used to offset their positions.</sentence>
		<sentence>The huge sell orders, which usually entered the market inthe final frantic minutes on expiration Fridays triggered wildprice swings in the 50 stocks which serve as the basis for theoptions and futures.</sentence>
		<sentence>The gyrations prompted the SEC last September to requestthat the Big Board ask its members submit all MOCs by 1530 hrson expiration Fridays, which would then be made public, givingthe market a half-hour to settle order imbalances.</sentence>
		<sentence>But in a March 12 letter to NYSE President Robert Birnbaum,SEC Director of Market Regulation cited problems in theexperimental procedure during the Dec 19 expiration Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence>A large number of MOC buy orders were not placed untilafter 1530 EST on Dec 19, which helped send the Dow JonesIndustrial Average up 21 points in the final minutes of the dayto a 14.20-point gain on the day, Ketchum said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Citing the SEC's concern about such trading, Ketchum askedthe exchange to tighten its procedure by not accepting anypre-existing MOC orders after 1530 if they could have beenplaced earlier.</sentence>
		<sentence>The new restriction, which SEC officials said merelyclarifies the terms of the existing experimental procedure,would bar the liquidation of stocks through MOC orders forarbitrage purposes after 1530 hrs, even if they offset otherreported order imbalances in those stocks.</sentence>

		<sentence>Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actualpositive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3.</sentence>
		<sentence>February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limitsset by the Fed for 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>The annual growth target for both is5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>There is no M-1 target.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for theFed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in moneygrowth," said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman GovernmentSecurities Inc.    Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetarygrowth in March after February's anemic growth rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>However,they stress that money growth will not be strong enough toprevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if theeconomy shows evidence of weakness.</sentence>
		<sentence>Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate,Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in moneymarket deposits at banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>This number has risen three to fourbillion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February'sweakness is not likely to persist.</sentence>
		<sentence>Slifer expects modest M-2and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.</sentence>
		<sentence>Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should returnto the five to seven pct annualized growth region and socontinue to present no problem for the Fed.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable withits current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhapsseveral more months of economic data before deciding whether ornot to ease its grip on reserves.</sentence>
		<sentence>Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analystsagreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will chooseto raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it nextchanges policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Discount window borrowings in the past week were about aslow as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above sixpct," said Williams of Bankers Trust.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funds averaged 6.12 pctin the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs onMonday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday.</sentence>
		<sentence>On Tuesday, it addedreserves directly through two-day System repurchases.</sentence>
		<sentence>Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds ratebe largely market-driven.</sentence>

		<subject>COLOMBIA'S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE</subject>
		<sentence>Colombia intends to improve themarketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility onsetting export registration prices, finance minister CesarGaviria said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower exportregistration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dockNew York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In the first stage, we decided not only to lower thereintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro thatwill allow private exporters to participate more actively inColombia's coffee export policy," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Traders said this means the export registration price willchange more often in a truer reflection of market trends.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new marketfactors since a return to a system of International CoffeeOrganisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the shortterm.</sentence>
		<sentence>ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlockover re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily sufferfrom depressed prices because it can compensate lower priceswith increased volume.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount ofcoffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will doso without an agreement among producers," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5mln bags as mentioned in market circles, "because the idea isprecisely not to disrupt the market."</sentence>
		<sentence>Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86coffee year which ended last September 30.</sentence>
		<sentence>Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of thenational coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought toadapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There is great expectation in the world for the policiesthat Brazil and Colombia will adopt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ours is beginning toemerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in theimmediate future," he told journalists.</sentence>
		<sentence>Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future exportpolicy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place whenproblems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talkshave been resolved.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta sayingIndonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil tosuggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said theBrazilian stand was quite clear.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Brazil's current quota "reflects the reality of themarket, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand," butadded more clarity was needed to assess the criteria thatdetermined it.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failureof the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear amongdealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producerswould go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,which did not happen.</sentence>

		<sentence>Institutional investors are finding itdifficult to find "the best price" for transactions in U.K.Government bonds (gilts) and have become more active in themarket since the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange inOctober, agency broker Capel-Cure Myers said in a survey.</sentence>
		<sentence>The survey, covering a broad section of institutionalinvestors, also showed that investors were uneasy about theimpartiality of market makers' advice.</sentence>
		<sentence>Given their concerns,over half those surveyed said they spend more time managingtheir portfolios.</sentence>
		<sentence>At the same time, the investors believed themarket was more liquid and efficient than before Big Bang.</sentence>
		<sentence>Capel-Cure, a unit of Australia and New Zealand BankingGroup Ltd, conducted the survey during January among 70institutions which are not clients of that firm.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banks and merchant banks accounted for 32 pct of the total,building societies 30 pct, life assurance companies 20 pct,insurance companies 11 pct and pension funds seven pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>The survey found that with the virtual elimination ofcommissions, the improved market liquidity has encouragedinvestors to deal more frequently in the market.</sentence>
		<sentence>Of thoseresponding, 70 pct were encouraged to deal more actively, 25pct which saw no change and five pct dealt less actively.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Capel-Cure official told reporters the elimination ofcommissions has made the market more competitive.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Capel-Cure has deliberately set low commisstionsbecause of this.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nearly half the respondents said they now have their owndealing team to cope with the new market, although thedefinition of a "dealing team" was ambiguous, the survey said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Rather than being a self-contained, specialised group ofdealers who spend all their time searching for prices, thedefinition now appears to be the less formal idea of amulti-purpose fund manager, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The survey supported the general view in the gilt marketthat a shake-out of the 27 market-makers is likely.</sentence>
		<sentence>It showed nearly 90 pct of the respondents believed thatthe total number of market makers in three years time would beless than 20, while 46 pct thought the number would be lessthan 15.</sentence>

		<subject>PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS FINELY POISED, BANKERS SAY</subject>
		<sentence>Debt talks between the Philippinegovernment and its bank advisory committee were delicatelypoised after a brief meeting between the two sides today,bankers and sources close to the Philippine delegation said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We had a businesslike meeting and made good progress," abanker said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The banks are anxious to come to an agreement."</sentence>
		<sentence>But bankers were reluctant to predict whether the talkswould end successfully.</sentence>
		<sentence>Caution was also evident in thePhilippine camp.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We feel the ball's in the banks' court," onesource said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The two sides will meet again on Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence>The talks, in which the Philippines is seeking toreschedule about 9.4 billion dlrs of debt, are now dominatedby a discussion of the innovative proposal made by financeminister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the country's interestbill in Philippine Investment Notes, PINs, instead of cash.</sentence>
		<sentence>Manila wants to pay the London Interbank Offered Rate incash and to issue PINs in respect of the margin above LIBOR.</sentence>
		<sentence>The banks rejected the original PINs proposal last Friday,but Ongpin presented a revised proposal on Monday which soughtto satisfy the banks' objections by guaranteeing that the noteswould yield 7/8 pct over LIBOR in cash.</sentence>
		<sentence>The banks have apparently yet to pass final judgment on thenew proposal.</sentence>
		<sentence>Senior Reagan Administration officials expressed warmsupport for the PINs proposal this week, which gave Ongpin hopethat the banks would embrace the idea.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the banks are still being circumspect, weighingpossible accounting consequences as well as considering theprecedents that they would set if they agreed to PINS.</sentence>
		<sentence>One of the  main architects of the PINs proposal, U.S.lawyer Lee Buchheit, is adamant that the banks have nothing toworry about.</sentence>
		<sentence>"To the extent that it's a precedent, it's a precedent tobe encouraged," Buchheit, a partner with Cleary, Gottlieb,Steen and Hamilton, told a debt-equity swaps conferencesponsored by Euromoney magazine.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the proposal, banks would sell the dollar-denominatedPINs at a discount to multinational firms which would convertthem into pesos at face value to fund government-approvedequity investments in the Philippines.</sentence>
		<sentence>In effect, international firms would be paying part ofManila's interest bill, allowing the government to conservemuch-needed hard currency.</sentence>
		<sentence>One of the beauties of the scheme, according to Buchheit,is that it widens the scope of third-world debt negotiations,which have been confined to debtors and creditors for the past4-1/2 years.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There's another pool of cash at the table now," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>David Mulford, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury,told the Euromoney conference that ideas such as PINs should bepart of a "menu" of options available to banks instead of purenew-money packages.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the difficulty of syndicating Mexico's 7.7 billiondlr loan package shows that new approaches must be encouraged.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devisingnew money packages may, in effect, be essential to future banksyndications," Mulford said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In an unusually frank comment about the Mexican deal, hesaid that dissatisfaction with Mexico's economic program andcriticism of communication and coordination within the banksyndicate had prompted a number of banks to refuse toparticipate in the loan.</sentence>
		<sentence>This refusal "for a time appeared to jeopardize theprospects for successful agreement with the rest of the banks,"Mulford said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Mexican package is now due to be signed on March 20,but bankers said the U.S. clearly feels the need to breathe newlife into the financing process, especially with crucialnegotiations with Brazil, about to start.</sentence>
		<sentence>The banks for their part insist that they are more thanwilling to discuss Mulford's "menu", and say it is the debtorsthat need to be more flexible.</sentence>
		<sentence>For example, they say financingtalks with Argentina are proving tough because Buenos Airesdislikes the debt-equity schemes and onlending provisions thatthe banks are promoting.</sentence>
		<sentence>But whether the banks are ready toendorse the PINs concept right away still hangs in the balance.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT</subject>
		<sentence>Senior U.S. Economic officialsdisagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budgetdeficit reduction targets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of EconomicAdvisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition toa tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cuttingspending and fostering economic growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the CongressionalBudget Office, said the budget process has broken down and thedeficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York Universitythat spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on thedesire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibilityfor local projects to state governments.</sentence>
		<sentence>He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows thePresident to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, tolimit wasteful spending.</sentence>
		<sentence>Spending and taxing decisions shouldbe linked more closely.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pctgrowth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and3.5 pct in 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate ofeconomic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks prettygood to me.</sentence>
		<sentence>We've had two very strong employment reports."</sentence>
		<sentence>He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,"It looks like they're on track."</sentence>
		<sentence>While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.</sentence>
		<sentence>The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the taxreform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and willgreatly increase private production incentives, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggestnational net output of goods and services will permanentlyincrease by approximately two pct because of the long-runconsequences of tax reform," Sprinkel said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In 1986, this wouldhave amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in theincome of the average American family."</sentence>
		<sentence>Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsiblefor the large increase in the budget deficit.</sentence>
		<sentence>In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amountedto 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct ofGNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage pointshigher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budgetdeficits of the past few years," Sprinkel said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced taxincreases that occurred between 1978 and 1981," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Pennerargued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxesenormously without any plan to decrease spending by theAdministration or Congress, indeed with increases in defencespending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)are unpleasant," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideologicalturmoil in the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Caused by the "biggest sustained inflationin our nation's history," which helped foster widespreaddistrust of government.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The American people turned on the government with taxrevolt at the state level and new demands on the government atthe national level," Penner said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislikeof spending programs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Now the correction of that 1981 mistakedemands that the system change a lot."</sentence>
		<sentence>Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budgetdeficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit willremain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily isnot likely to succeed.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries todictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simplybecause there's no ... Way to enforce it," Penner said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budgetdeficit was cut.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminatedby one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxesrelated to tax reform and sales of government assets.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creativetiming changes, like moving the military payday from the lastday of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>That savedmore than two billion dlrs," Penner said.</sentence>

		<sentence>China has to decide if it will increasesugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output andrising demand, in view of market predictions that internationalsugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and theofficial press said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry andFisheries, said this week that China has adjusted thepurchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop inproduction last year but he gave no price details.</sentence>
		<sentence>One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidlybecause of improving living standards and rising demand forsweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in astate-controlled economy.</sentence>
		<sentence>China may have to import," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes inJanuary 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>The official Economic Information newspaper last month saidproduction in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April)will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.</sentence>
		<sentence>The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beethas fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has droppedand cannot meet demand that is rising every day," it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The country will have to continue imports of sugar and drawdown stocks to meet market demand," it added.</sentence>
		<sentence>It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming thedrop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for caneand beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmersrefusing to grow them.</sentence>
		<sentence>The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to threetimes more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up toseven times more from bananas than from sugarcane.</sentence>
		<sentence>He couldsell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices havenot changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuanin 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losingmoney.</sentence>
		<sentence>China has 521 sugar mills.</sentence>
		<sentence>A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in caneacreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct inGuangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct ofChina's sugar in calendar 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said both provinces are more developed than othersugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.</sentence>
		<sentence>But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87,because cane-growing is more economic there, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mlnat end-January.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Now they are falling but (they) have notreached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,"he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"China has options not easily available in westerncountries.</sentence>
		<sentence>It controls stocks strictly and can release lessinto the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will beslightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world pricesand serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, arelikely to continue until at least end-1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-ownedmills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many ofthem using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s," he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>When SIMEX and the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) introducedU.S. Treasury bond futures last autumn, the sources expected tosee fierce rivalry between the two exchanges, ending with onlyone winner in Asia.</sentence>
		<sentence>But surprisingly, the challenges now appear to be comingfrom the other side of the world, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) will introduce nighttrading in its U.S. Treasury bond contract on April 30, whichcould clash with SIMEX morning activity, banking sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The CBOT had planned to introduce night trading on April 2,but postponed the move to allow participants time to prepare.</sentence>
		<sentence>The London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE)could cut further into the SIMEX contract with a U.S. Treasurybond contract that can be offset on the CBOT, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Such aLIFFE contract is expected later this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>LIFFE liquidity could be higher than at the SIMEX, whereaverage daily volume in Treasury bonds dropped to 165 inFebruary from 1,286 last October when the bonds were firstintroduced.</sentence>
		<sentence>The contracts were set up to attract hedging from therapidly growing underlying cash market in U.S. Treasury bondsin Toyko, but interest has waned as that market has grown morestable, traders said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Restrictions on investments by Japanese residents have alsoinhibited the growth of the futures contracts in both Singaporeand Sydney, the banking sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nevertheless, all 450 seats on SIMEX are now taken, withthe last trading at 55,000 dlrs against the initial price of50,000 dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>The current bid is 55,500 dlrs, but offers at65,000 show that confidence in SIMEX remains, said MichaelKillian, general manager of Chase Manhattan Futures Corp.

		<sentence>SIMEX also became more competitive after this month'sbudget eliminated withholding tax on interest earned on futuresmargin deposits.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banking sources said the tax change would boost SIMEXtrading by non-bank institutions and individuals and wouldbenefit foreign firms and institutions.</sentence>
		<sentence>While the Treasury bond contract has been somewhatdisappointing, other SIMEX contracts continue to expand, FongYew Meng, SIMEX assistant general manager, told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>Volume in the SIMEX's Nikkei stock index, based on theTokyo stock market, has risen to a daily average of more than1,000 contracts this month, from 320 contracts last October,helped by uncertainty during the recent bull run in Tokyostocks, Fong said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Open interest in the Nikkei contract, introduced last year,reached a record 2,697 on February 26.</sentence>
		<sentence>Killian said the Nikkei contract has considerable potentialfor expansion, as overseas investors have been avoiding thecontract because they currently see no need to hedge the risingcash market in Tokyo.</sentence>

		<sentence>"They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,"Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North AmericanDivision told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked theWhite House to consider blocking the sale of <FairchildSemiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T>, U.S.Officials said yesterday.</sentence>

		<sentence>Pentagon officials said Defence SecretaryCaspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale.</sentence>

		<sentence>Two separate issues appear to have come together to boostpressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Most market analysts now expect a two-pence reduction inthe basic rate of taxation and a lowering in of the top rate ofincome tax from 60 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>A one billion stg cut in the 1987/88 PSBR - to six billionstg - is considered the minimum needed for reassuring financialmarkets, they add.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Treasury's inflow of tax receipts has far surpassedthat previously envisaged, economists say.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lawson as recentlyas December 17 said that "I very much doubt whether there willbe much scope for reductions in taxation in next year's budget."</sentence>
		<sentence>The Conservative government is eager to get the basic rateof tax down to 25 pct as soon as possible, since every poundoff the tax base would make the opposition Labour Party'sspending plans look more painful to the electorate, analystssay.</sentence>
		<sentence>The direct revenue effect of a one penny change in thebasic rate of income tax would be about 1.1 billion stg in1987/88 and 1.45 billion stg in 1988/89, Treasury figures show.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lawson's budget speech to Parliament on Tuesday starts at1530 GMT, and is sure to echo the government's distinct tone ofoptimism, analysts say.</sentence>
		<sentence>The tax measures which Lawson is expected to announce willbe based firmly on a positive assessment of past economicachievements and confidence for the future, they add.</sentence>
		<sentence>But even if he does cut his planned PSBR for 1987/88 bybetween one and 1.5 billion stg, as most economists predict,Lawson is still likely to find himself announcing a higher PSBRthan the outturn for this financial year.^M    That could leave him with a presentation problem,economists say.</sentence>
		<sentence>A lower PSBR would raise financial confidence by reassuringmarkets that the borrowing burden imposed by the governmentwould stay low even if certain key aspects of the budget'sarithmetic seem over-optimistic, economists say    Lawson is slated to reaffirm the government's goals, as setout in its Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS), of reducinginflation and raising economic growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>Regarding monetary targets, some analysts expect him todrop the wayward broad money aggregate, sterling M-3, whileretaining the tamer M0 narrow measure.</sentence>
		<sentence>Few foresee any othermonetary aggregate being chosen by Lawson for formal targeting.</sentence>

		<sentence>Analystshad expected the authorities to wait until after the budget.</sentence>
		<sentence>Further declines in bank base lending rates are anticipatedafter the budget.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many analysts foresee them falling by as muchas a full percentage point from the current 10.5 pct level.</sentence>
		<sentence>The main electoral attraction of reducing interest rates isto cut mortgage borrowing costs, and thus reduce inflation,analysts say.</sentence>

		<sentence>"We expect already in 1987approximately to break even.</sentence>
		<sentence>That presupposes, however, thatour industrial environment does not worsen."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of pastlosses.</sentence>
		<sentence>Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion andnet turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a newsconference the new management installed a year ago had decidedto restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminaterights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as anasset.</sentence>
		<sentence>Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took angross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from472 mln in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining,after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiaryin the United States.</sentence>
		<sentence>There were no extraordinary gains in1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves andexceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this "radicalelimination of the mortgages of the past" painful, but said thefoundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.</sentence>

		<sentence>Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pctin 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse hadarranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank ofSwitzerland <SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp <SBVZ.Z> and CreditSuisse <CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into asubordinated loan.</sentence>
		<sentence>The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and notcash losses, Haerri said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Existing credit lines were used onlyto a small extent, and the parent company had been granted anew credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swissbanks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintainingbauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.</sentence>
		<sentence>That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc lossinstead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.</sentence>

		<subject>AIRBUS FACES A340 DECISION AS DEADLINE LOOMS</subject>
		<sentence>The supervisory board of theEuropean consortium, <Airbus Industrie>, has begun a criticalmeeting to review government funding and airline orders for itsproposed A340 long range jet, Airbus officials here said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Airbus insists it needs five airlines to firmly committhemselves to the plane before going ahead with the project bythe month's end, the deadline for its launch.</sentence>
		<sentence>The plane, a four-engined widebodied jet, has so far onlybeen bought by one airline -- <Lufthansa>, which has placed 15firm orders and 15 options for the plane.</sentence>
		<sentence>But while Air France has said it wants to buy seven of theaircraft, it has not yet formally placed an order.</sentence>
		<sentence>Discussionswith up to a dozen other airlines have not yet resulted inpublic commitments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Apart from a shortage of orders, Airbus also is facing anuphill struggle persuading its member governments to fund the2.5 billion dlr project, which involves not only the A340 butits sister A330 aircraft, a twin engined, wide bodied mediumrange jet with many identical components.</sentence>
		<sentence>The British government remains unconvinced that there willbe sufficient room in the world long range jet market.</sentence>
		<sentence>The West German government is also uncommitted, and iscurrently pressing for a restructuring of the consortium's WestGerman company, <Deutsche Airbus GmbH>, while only the Frenchgovernment appears to be fully behind the program.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another major factor delaying a final decision on the planehas been the engine which will power it.</sentence>
		<sentence>Airbus agreed lastOctober with <CFM International> that its CFM-56 engine with28,600 lbs of thrust would power the plane.</sentence>
		<sentence>But in December,Airbus announced an agreement with CFM rival <InternationalAero Engine> (IAE) to power a slightly larger version of theA340 with a 30,000 lb thrust high-technology superfan engine.</sentence>
		<sentence>Airbus has made clear to potential customers that the IAEengine is now the principle engine for the project.</sentence>
		<sentence>Theincorporation of the superfan engine made the plane on papermore attractive to airlines, but the engine has yet to bedeveloped and CFM International had openly expressed scepticismthat the engine will be ready when the plane goes into service.</sentence>
		<sentence>The future of the Airbus consortium depends on the rightdecision being made on the A340 in the next few weeks, for itcould find itself severely exposed in the 1990s either bystaying absent from the long range jet market or by committingitself to a commercially unviable project.</sentence>

		<sentence>Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York Universitythat spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on thedesire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibilityfor local projects to state governments.</sentence>
		<sentence>He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows thePresident to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, tolimit wasteful spending.</sentence>
		<sentence>Spending and taxing decisions shouldbe linked more closely.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pctgrowth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and3.5 pct in 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate ofeconomic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks prettygood to me.</sentence>
		<sentence>We've had two very strong employment reports."</sentence>
		<sentence>He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,"It looks like they're on track."</sentence>
		<sentence>While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.</sentence>
		<sentence>The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the taxreform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and willgreatly increase private production incentives, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggestnational net output of goods and services will permanentlyincrease by approximately two pct because of the long-runconsequences of tax reform," Sprinkel said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In 1986, this wouldhave amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in theincome of the average American family."</sentence>
		<sentence>Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsiblefor the large increase in the budget deficit.</sentence>
		<sentence>In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amountedto 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct ofGNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage pointshigher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budgetdeficits of the past few years," Sprinkel said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced taxincreases that occurred between 1978 and 1981," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Pennerargued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxesenormously without any plan to decrease spending by theAdministration or Congress, indeed with increases in defencespending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)are unpleasant," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideologicalturmoil in the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Caused by the "biggest sustained inflationin our nation's history," which helped foster widespreaddistrust of government.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The American people turned on the government with taxrevolt at the state level and new demands on the government atthe national level," Penner said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislikeof spending programs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Now the correction of that 1981 mistakedemands that the system change a lot."</sentence>
		<sentence>Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budgetdeficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit willremain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily isnot likely to succeed.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries todictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simplybecause there's no ... Way to enforce it," Penner said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budgetdeficit was cut.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminatedby one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxesrelated to tax reform and sales of government assets.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creativetiming changes, like moving the military payday from the lastday of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>That savedmore than two billion dlrs," Penner said.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. URGES BANKS TO DEVELOP NEW 3RD WLD FINANCE</subject>
		<sentence>The United States this week signaledit is pressing commercial banks, increasingly disenchanted withproviding large cash loans to debtor nations, to develop newways of financing that will prove more acceptable to bothsides.</sentence>
		<sentence>Heading off challenges to its Third World debt strategy,U.S. officials also say they think concessions should be madeto debtors that enact reforms speeding inflation-free growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>In particular, they stress new techniques that shift theemphasis from debt to equity and shave interest rates.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative orconcept that there can be additional emphasis such as indebt-equity swaps and that sort of thing," a Reaganadministration official said of the slow pace of commercialbank lending to the Third World.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The debtors have been performing well...some people arguethat taking 1-1/8 pct down to 13/16 pct is debt forgiveness.</sentence>
		<sentence>Well if that's what it is, fine.</sentence>
		<sentence>What it really is a narrowingof the spread that could be charged on new money," the officialsaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>This week, therefore, U.S. officials signaled their backingfor a novel proposal by the Philippines that called for partialpayment of interest in tradeable investment notes.</sentence>
		<sentence>On Tuesday, officials said Treasury Secretary James Bakertold Secretary of State George Shultz the idea was a creativeone and signaled his approval to Philippine Finance MinisterJamie Ongpin later that day.</sentence>
		<sentence>An administration official toldReuters this week the Philippines' proposal to partially payinterest with investment notes instead of cash should beconsidered seriously by the banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>An agreement with the banks,officials now say, is expected soon.</sentence>
		<sentence>"New bank lending has been slow in materializing but thefact of the matter is there have been 70 billion dlrs in bankloans restructured, which is a form of extension of credit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asyou know, there's been 8.5 billion dlrs in new money," said theofficial, who plays a key role in keeping the plan afloat.</sentence>
		<sentence>The plan was launched in October 1985 by Secretary Bakerand called on commercial and multilateral banks to lend 29billion dlrs in the subsequent three years to major debtorsundertaking reforms that promoting economic growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>But it has taken almost six months to complete thesyndication of a 7.5 billion dlrs loan to Mexico, which hascreated deep misgivings here about the liklihood of such largestraight cash loans being assembled ever again.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. officials want the banks not only to consider swappingtheir debts for equity in local corporations -- a developmentthat has already met with success in Chile and Mexico -- but topin loans on specific projects, finance trade and investdirectly in debtor country private sectors.</sentence>
		<sentence>These forms of lending, they say, give the banks a greaterstake and more economically secure return on investment.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a major challenge to the U.S. plan, Brazil last monthdeclared a moratorium on interest payments and followed it upwith a world tour by officials seeking a political way out ofits 109 billion dlr debt burden.</sentence>
		<sentence>The country is beset by a falling trade surplus anddwindling reserves endangering its ability to service itsforeeign debt, at 109 billion dlrs the Third World's largest.</sentence>
		<sentence>One official attending the Washington talks with BrazilianFinance Minister Dilson Funaro said "they've come in here nowand said "Look, we're out of money, help us," but they haven'tcome in with a plan.</sentence>
		<sentence>And they've gone all over the world, andat every stop they've been told the same thing."</sentence>
		<sentence>The official said Brazil would have to enact a credibleeconomic program, either in consultation with the World Bank orthe International Monetary Fund, to cool its overheated economybefore commercial banks would begin negotiations.</sentence>
		<sentence>As a result of the Brazilian action, private banks andmajor debtor nations redoubled their efforts to reachagreements stretching out debt repayments.</sentence>
		<sentence>For its part, the administration has signaled its strongsupport for new techniques that in some cases effectivelyamount to interest rate concessions for major debtor nations.</sentence>
		<sentence>It pressed the banks to allow Chile to make annual insteadof bi-annual interest payments, speeding an accord.</sentence>
		<sentence>Administration officials, who asked not to be named, havealso debated whether to allow banks greater flexibility inbuilding up loan loss reserves against Third World loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>The debate centers on a rule, known as FASB-15, under whichbanks experiencing delayed interest payments on real estateloans need not set aside reserves against debt principal if itis believed payments will resume.</sentence>
		<sentence>More recently, the rule was extended to cover farm andenergy loans and Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,has suggested it should be extended to Third World loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bradley is prominent among Congressmen urging thatprovisions for debt relief be attached to tough new tradelegislation now being considered on Capitol Hill.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the officials said the debate has been inconclusive.</sentence>

		<sentence>The continued strength of the Swiss francagainst the dollar will largely deprive Swiss exporters of thebenefits of the upturn in the world economy, a quarterly studyby the Economics Department said.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said the export industry would scarcely get a boost fromthe upturn in the economies of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD), and predicted declines innew orders for highly export-orientated firms.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, domestic demand, which stagnated in the lastquarter of 1986, would resume its growth, fuelled by higherreal incomes and buoyant consumer sentiment, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The study, which was drawn up by the department'sCommission for Economic Questions, said industrial productionwould scarcely increase, with most firms apparently happy withcurrent numbers of workers.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, an increase in labour demand in the service sectorshould help push up total employment, it said.</sentence>

		<sentence>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME)board of directors issued a letter to its members that setslimits, but does not ban, dual trading in the S and P 500futures and options pit.</sentence>
		<sentence>The rules prohibit brokers who execute customer orders to trade for their own account, or engage in dual trading, fromthe top step of the pit -- which the board defines as ageographically advantageous position in the pit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brokers who engage in dual trading in other areas of thepit must record to the nearest minute those personal trades.</sentence>
		<sentence>The board will also set as yet unspecified percentagelimits on the trades brokers can conduct among "broker groups,"otherwise known as "trading rings."</sentence>
		<sentence>By issuing its own rules, the CME's board rejected apetition presented in February by some CME members that soughtto prohibit dual trading of any kind in the S and P 500 pits.</sentence>
		<sentence>The full CME membership will vote on the petition, since itwas rejected by the board, by April 13.</sentence>
		<sentence>If the members rejectthe petition, the board would be free to implement its rules, aCME spokesman said.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the members can vote to adopt thepetition and institute a total ban on dual trading.</sentence>
		<sentence>The board's rules on dual trading, if implemented, wouldprohibit brokers from trading for their own account once theyhave executed a customer order from the top step of the pit.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's a step in the right direction," said stock futuresanalysts William Marcus of Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette Inc.    "It's very difficult to engage in large broker businessfrom anywhere but the top step," he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Citicorp denied financial marketrumors that it has written off some of its loans to LatinAmerican debtors,    "Rumors that we have written off any of our Latin Americandebt are unfounded," a Citicorp spokesman told Reuters inresponse to London-based rumors in the money markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Citicorp is the largest bank group in the U.S. and one ofthe biggest lenders to Latin America, with some eight to ninebillion dlrs outstanding to Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, bankanalysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In response to more specific market rumors that it hadtaken action on its exposure to Brazil, Citicorp said it madean 8-K filing on the subject with the Securities and ExchangeCommission on Tuesday in relation to a registration statementfor a preferred stock issue.</sentence>
		<sentence>Citing the filing, Citicorp said that Brazil's recentsuspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofcommercial bank debt and related actions "may require Citicorpto place 3.9 billion dlrs of intermediate and long-termBrazilian loans on a cash basis."</sentence>
		<sentence>When loans are placed on a cash basis, interest orprincipal payments are only booked when received instead ofbeing accrued on their due dates, analysts noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Citicorp said in the 8-K filing that "it ispremature to make such a decision at this time in view of thefluidity of the situation and management's high confidence inthe long-term outlook for Brazil."</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil's new central bank governor Francisco Gros metsenior commercial bankers here on Wednesday and Citicorp saidformal talks on Brazil's recent actions and future financingneeds should begin in "the near future".</sentence>
		<sentence>Citicorp said in the filing, "the issue will bere-evaluated at the end of the first quarter."</sentence>
		<sentence>The bank group continued, "if it is decided that theseloans to Brazil should be placed on a cash basis, Citicorpestimates, based on existing interest rates, that the impact inthe first quarter would be approximately 50 mln dlrs after taxand for the full year would be approximately 190 mln dlrs aftertax."</sentence>
		<sentence>It added that these amounts include interest accrued in1986 that has not yet been collected.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY</subject>
		<sentence>The European Monetary System marks itseighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world moneymarkets despite creating an island of currency rate stabilityin Europe, economists say.</sentence>
		<sentence>But many economists say the system,which holds eight European Community currencies within narrowfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.</sentence>
		<sentence>Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), hasbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alikeseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu asEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming realitywhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.</sentence>
		<sentence>But economists say members such as West Germany have so farblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system'sfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt andformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under this phase, originally due to have started two yearsafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have beentransferred from national governments and central banks to anautonomous European Monetary Fund.</sentence>
		<sentence>But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty ineconomic and monetary matters.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The basic problem of the EMS isthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to asituation where certain decisions are taken in common," said oneeconomist who has closely watched the system's development.</sentence>
		<sentence>The result is that the EC is often divided over policy onthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is thesystem's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged andinvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharprise of the West German mark severely strained the system.</sentence>
		<sentence>MORE    As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose againstEMS currencies less favoured by international investors.</sentence>
		<sentence>And asWest Germany last year refused to give in pressure from severalEC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slowthe mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to easefinancial and trade strains within the community.</sentence>
		<sentence>Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revaluedby three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pctagainst other currencies in the system -- the French franc,Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend theEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major worldcurrency, outside the system.</sentence>
		<sentence>No change in the British government's attitude is expectedbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since itwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC'shighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of CentralBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.</sentence>
		<sentence>Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministershold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.</sentence>
		<sentence>But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involvemore than tinkering with technical details.</sentence>
		<sentence>They are scepticalabout the chances for any fundamental change.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMSagainst external factors such as dollar weakness.</sentence>
		<sentence>For that wemust take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leode Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists say the system's fortunes now will dependlargely on the success of an agreement last month among majorindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates.</sentence>

		<sentence>At present, if the market price has been above or below thereference price (set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kiloin the current agreement) for six months, the reference priceis revised by five pct or by an amount decided by theInternational Natural Rubber Organisation council.</sentence>

		<sentence>It now appears that consumers may consider dropping theirinsistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, calledthe "lower indicative price," under certain circumstances.</sentence>
		<sentence>This means that any possible compromise would centre on thereference price, and the "may buy" (or "may sell") and "must buy" or"must sell" levels, without changing the "lower indicative price"-- which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the currentpact.</sentence>

		<subject>FRN PANIC INITIATED, EXACERBATED BY MARKET MAKERS</subject>
		<sentence>Today's panic in the floating rate notemarket has been simmering for months and is, in many ways, ofthe market makers' own doing, traders and bank officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"For the last six months, there have been a series of crisesin the FRN market.</sentence>
		<sentence>Each has cut deeper and deeper into the veryfibre of the market," said a senior official at a U.S. Bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>As prices have fallen, he explained, the underwriters whooriginally brought the issues have retreated.</sentence>
		<sentence>They havedivested themselves of the paper as quickly as possible,unwilling to bear losses of the magnitude seen in recent panictrading.</sentence>
		<sentence>In the virtual effective closure of the market forperpetual floaters last month, bankers witnessed theconsequences of this kind of contraction of liquidity andinvestor confidence.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fears were engendered about the possibility of this crisisinfecting the market in conventional dated FRN issues, which isalmost 10 times as large as that for perpetuals, with anestimated 130 billion dlrs of debt outstanding.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The professionals are so nervous about holding inventorythat they will sell at any price," said an official at a leadingU.S. Bank, explaining the panic selling which has pushed pricesdown sharply over the last two days.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers and FRN traders emphasised that today's trading wasunique in that it was driven exclusively by professionals andthat there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the securitiesthey sold.</sentence>
		<sentence>In highlighting this point, dealers noted that thebenchmark issues in the FRN market -- the two FRN's for theU.K., Launched in 1985 and 1986 -- fell an unprecedented 50 and40 basis points, respectively, at the opening this morning.</sentence>
		<sentence>Certainly, dealers said, Britain is no less credit-worthytoday than it was yesterday and the country's economic healthcurrently appears better than it has for some time.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pointing out that this kind of sovereign and supra-nationaldebt had not sagged on any fundamental weakness, one senior FRNsource said: "The idiocy of the situation is aptly shown by thefact that these kind of borrowers can now tap the syndicatedloan markets at rates lower than their floaters currently pay."</sentence>
		<sentence>Dealers agreed that banking sector paper, which constitutesa significant part of the market, was currently under pressure.</sentence>
		<sentence>Floating rate debt of major U.S. And Canadian banks easedmarkedly in nervous trading last month on renewed investorfears about the banks' exposure to Latin American debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S. And Canadian money centre bank FRNs, along withRepublic of Ireland paper, were hard hit again this week withdealers citing one heavily-traded Citicorp note falling tolevels so low it is now effectively yielding 55 basis pointsover Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate).</sentence>
		<sentence>By comparison, the 500 mln dlr note which matures in 1998yielded only a fine 20 basis point over Libid (the LondonInterbank Bid Rate) when it was issued in January last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Price declines of this size can really only be explained byan understanding of the operating practices of leading playersin the market, dealers and banking analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This has to be understood as a matter between banks whohave a brief to buy low and sell high," one U.S. Bank sourcenoted.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another senior source at a U.K. Bank drew attention to theenormous overhead costs and high salaries generated over thelast few years in the FRN market, which have to be justified.</sentence>
		<sentence>But even beyond the cost of running an FRN trading desk,dealers said, is the way the securities are bought and sold.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although sophisticated on-screen dealing exists in mostmarkets, in the euro-markets trading is conducted by telephone.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If somebody calls you up and asks you to make him a pricein any issue, and you do, he can say "Right.</sentence>
		<sentence>You own five mln',"a trader said, explaining market practice.</sentence>
		<sentence>The unfortunate buyer is then forced to unload thesecurities just minutes later to yet another firm at an evenlower price, the trader explained.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is precisely this phenomenon that forced the rapiddownward price spiral earlier today, traders said, adding thatit is likely to continue until the markets either regain theirconfidence or market practices change.</sentence>
		<sentence>One possible solution, dealers said, would be to initiatetrading exclusively through brokers' screens, so that onlythose who wanted to buy bonds would have to "lift a bid" or buyat that price.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, bank regulators are apparently concerned aboutthe implications of the collapse in FRN prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Traders in London said that the Bank of England has calledaround to market makers asking whether they intended tocontinue trading and what they calculated the losses to be.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank often makes periodic checks in the market, butdealers said the latest enquiries were more specific.</sentence>
		<sentence>A spokesman for the Bank of England was not able to commentimmediately on the Bank's action.</sentence>
		<sentence>One trader at a major U.S. Bank here said that in addition,the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's international capitalmarkets unit has phoned banks in London today seekinginformation about trading in FRN's.</sentence>
		<sentence>He also said that this wasnot an unusual procedure.</sentence>

		<subject>PROPOSALS TO RELAX U.S. DRUG LAWS POSE PROBLEMS</subject>
		<sentence>The Reagan Administration's soon-to-bepublished proposals to make experimental therapies more rapidlyand widely available to terminally ill patients pose productliability problems for drug companies, experts in thepharmaceutical field said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Details of the proposals will be published in the FederalRegister shortly and will become effective after a 90-daycomment period.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the proposed policy, announced Tuesday byCommissioner of Food and Drugs Frank E. Young at a pressconference, patients with life threatening diseases who are notenrolled in clinical trials would be allowed access to anexperimental therapy.</sentence>
		<sentence>The policy also allows drug companies tosell the promising drugs to patients.</sentence>
		<sentence>Previously drugs like AZT could be rushed into wider usefree-of-charge if the agent was shown to be effective.</sentence>
		<sentence>Underthe new policy, the FDA could only refuse to permit a physicianto administer an experimental drug if it was shown to beunsafe.</sentence>
		<sentence>Financial analysts said the plan would likely benefitbiotechnology companies with few or no products approved formarketing in the U.S., but would have little economic impact onlarge drug companies with many other sources of revenue.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Charging a fee for still experimental drugs could helpbiotech companies' near-term financial situation and help makethem less dependent on outside sources," said Teena Lerner, abiotech analyst at L.F. Rothchild.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other observers were concerned that drug companies would beput into a legal bind if promising drugs later proved to havedevastating side effects.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Before a lot of drug companies release these drugs theyare going to have to think long and hard about liability--theproduct liability problems are enormous," said aWashington-based lawyer who specializes in the drug field.</sentence>
		<sentence>Patients in clinical trials normally sign lengthy informedconsent papers before taking an investigational drug.</sentence>
		<sentence>Thelawyer said no more than two cases had gone to trial for suitsagainst a drug company's investigational drug.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The new proposals are a whole new kettle of fish," saidthe lawyer.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Drug companies are right now probably meeting withtheir insurance companies."</sentence>
		<sentence>Burroughs-Wellcome Co, the U.S. arm of the British firmWellcome PLC that makes AZT, Merck and Co Inc <MRK>,Hoffman-LaRoche Inc and SmithKline Beckman Corp <SKB> said itwas too soon to comment on the policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I'm very uncomforable with this," said Wellcomespokeswoman Kathy Bartlett.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We haven't had a chance toformulate a response yet.</sentence>
		<sentence>It's too early."</sentence>
		<sentence>But some financial analysts say the proposals would benefitdrug companies.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I find the proposal to be a very significant alteration ofthe FDA's past policies that should positively affect (drugcompanies') stocks," said drug analyst Davis Saks, with Morgan,Olmstead, Kennedy and Gardner.</sentence>
		<sentence>Saks also warned that many health care providers would balkat the proposal, and would call it "amoral" to charge patientswith life-threatening diseases for drugs that otherwise wouldbe given out for free in clinical trials.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jeffrey Warren, spokesman for the PharmaceuticalManufacturers Association, which represents the major drugfirms in the U.S., said "A mechanism already exists at the FDApermitting certain seriously ill patients access toexperimental drugs and perhaps that system can be approved."</sentence>
		<sentence>Warren acknowledged that the PMA may not be able to come upwith a consensus among its membership when the rules areformally published.</sentence>
		<sentence>He also admitted that product liability problems could be aconcern to major drug companies.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the National Gay andLesbian Task Force, which is actively in AIDS policy andfunding issues, cited the drug Suramin from Bayer AG <BAYRY>,which had shown early promise as an AIDS treatment, but onwider clinical testing was shown to have deadly side effects.</sentence>

		<subject>TALKING POINT/DOME PETROLEUM <DMP></subject>
		<sentence>Dome Petroleum Ltd's revised debtrestructuring plan keeps the company alive and improves itsappeal as a takeover target, but full debt repayment depends ona sharp oil price rise, oil and banking analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome's complex proposal to let creditors link some or allof their debt to oil-indexed debentures or convert it to equityis "very cut and dried and to the point," Peters and Co LtdCalgary-based energy analyst Wilf Gobert said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome "is saying, This is the way it is.</sentence>
		<sentence>There isn't enoughmoney to pay you back,'" he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The plan "strikes me as a very pragmatic thing to do,"First Marathon Securities Ltd oil analyst Jim Doak commented.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the plan seeks to formally tie payments tocreditors with the price of oil, which governs Dome's cash flowand ability to service its debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome expects its total debt to reach 6.4 billion Canadiandlrs by June 30, 1987, when an interim debt rescheduling planexpires and Dome hopes to implement the long term plan.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gobert said the plan would rank secured and unsecuredcreditors in a complex series of repayment categories or "anagreed pecking order of what your (creditors) claim to assetsis."</sentence>
		<sentence>Potential suitors would find Dome easier to swallow underthe debt restructuring plan because it proposes to resolvecompeting claims on assets pledged to secured creditors and onremaining unpledged assets, Gobert and others said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Certainly the restructuring plan, once it's agreed to andput in place, is going to make it easier for someone to come inand look at doing a deal on it (acquiring the company)," Gobertremarked.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's going to be a lot easier than it is right now becauseyou'll have settled the pecking order question," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gobert believes the debt plan may be partly motivated by adesire to sell Dome Petroleum as a whole.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If the creditors wanted to liquidate their bank loans theycould do it in an orderly fashion through the sale of thecompany, as opposed to dismemberment," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dome's proposal includes rescheduling secured debt paymentsover a 15 to 20 year schedule, linking payments to cash flowsgenerated by assets pledged against loans and establishinginterest rates that allow for changing oil prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Creditors' only real alternative to Dome's plan is "anasset grab which would liquidate the company at distressprices, and the banks would spend the next 20 years in courtdeciding who had what asset," First Marathon's Doak said.</sentence>
		<sentence>For Dome's creditors, the plan does not offer a quickmethod to recover loans, but extends payment time in the hopethat oil prices will rise, increasing the amount of thecompany's debt payments, Merrill Lynch Canada Inc bank analystTerry Shaunessy said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The plan "is not a solution.</sentence>
		<sentence>It says give me more time andlet's keep our fingers crossed that oil goes way up."</sentence>
		<sentence>Doak and Shaunessy estimated oil prices would have to riseto about 28 to 30 U.S. dlrs a barrel to fully service all ofthe company's debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said the plan would ensure the company continuesto operate, but provides little other benefit to commonshareholders.</sentence>
		<sentence>"From a common shareholder standpoint, all this does issort of keep him on the life support system, because thereisn't any equity unless you get a big increase in oil prices,"Gobert remarked.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said Dome's common shares, trading today at 1.12dlrs, off four cents, on the Toronto Stock Exchange,essentially represent a long term warrant pegged to oil prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>"You have to be looking at an extremely high price of oilin the context of historical trends before there's any residualvalue for the common shareholders," analyst Doak said.</sentence>
		<sentence>While Dome's plan said lenders will be able to convert debtto common shares, the amount of dilution depends on shareconversion prices still to be negotiated and how much lenderswould choose to convert, the company said.</sentence>

		<sentence>The request for White House cooperation was made yesterdayby Senate Budget Committee chairman Lawton Chiles at a meetingwith Baker, the source said.</sentence>

		<sentence>House Democrats have been meeting privately and willcontinue discussions on Tuesday to develop a plan for the fullcommittee which holds its first drafting meeting Thursday.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan's own budget was submitted in January but Congressgenerally has rejected it as unrealistic, with theCongressional Budget Office saying the deficit is understatedand should be a more realistic 134 billion dlrs.</sentence>

		<subject>FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U.S. FEBRUARY ECONOMY</subject>
		<sentence>U.S. February reports reflecting slimgains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressuresreinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continueto follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything," saidSteve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc.    "There are hints that GNP is picking up.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the inflationfront, all is well," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Money supply is well undercontrol.</sentence>
		<sentence>It's an absolutely ideal situation."</sentence>
		<sentence>February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightlyless than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.</sentence>
		<sentence>This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's productionnumber, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.</sentence>
		<sentence>The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise.</sentence>
		<sentence>This followed a 0.6 pctrise in the PPI in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Fed is going to look at this positively," said AllanLeslie of Discount Corporation.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Certainly inflation is not asbad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately.</sentence>
		<sentence>Industrialproduction growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants."</sentence>
		<sentence>The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct inFebruary, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflationis behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs perbarrel," said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "Thetrend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year."</sentence>
		<sentence>In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pctdecline in the PPI.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,but a sharp drop in auto prices was not.</sentence>
		<sentence>Passenger car pricesfell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said thata possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in boththe financial markets and the Federal Reserve.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectationstoday," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.</sentence>
		<sentence>While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easiermonetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise thiscould necessitate a weaker dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air," hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete withforeign producers."</sentence>
		<sentence>Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pctin February's PPI.</sentence>
		<sentence>With many electronic goods producedoverseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raisingprices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminishoverseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which mightnecessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting toa large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real valueof the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>Slifer said import prices may rise further asmanufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar droppedto current levels expire, and new contracts are made thatreflect a weaker dollar.</sentence>
		<sentence>David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that importedmanufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in thesecond half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.industrial output.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's the other side of the lower dollar," Wyss said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitiveand they are increasing output."</sentence>
		<sentence>Wyss said that the latest data point to an averageindustrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector isbeginning to revive."</sentence>
		<sentence>But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hesaid much of the strength came from factors that do not pointto a sustained rise in industrial output.</sentence>
		<sentence>Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farmequipment industries helped account for a one pct rise inFebruary business equipment production.</sentence>
		<sentence>Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energywas produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.</sentence>
		<sentence>Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted forhalf of the industrial production gain as production of autoassemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5million units.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In the first quarter, it looks like automakers areproducing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling atroughly a seven mln unit rate," Roach said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The disparitybetween output and sales is showing up in inventories."</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. businessinventories as a sign that production may be outstrippingdemand in the first quarter of 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gainsince July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the CommerceDepartment said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, thelargest monthly sales drop on record.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react tomonth-to-month changes.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Fed has been standing pat for thelast seven months," Ramirez said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They will continue to standpat for at least the next couple of months."</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT</subject>
		<sentence>A secondary market for resale offarm real estate loans similar to markets on home mortgages isgaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and couldbe set up this year, Congressional and financial sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Several bills which would establish a farm secondary markethave been introduced in both the House and Senate.</sentence>
		<sentence>Furthermore,Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankersand life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agreeon a method of establishing the market.</sentence>
		<sentence>Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,FCA, which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said afarm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture"as long as the farm credit system is a key player."</sentence>
		<sentence>Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing thesecondary market could be established either with Congressionallegislation or administratively.</sentence>
		<sentence>Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after thesuccessful resale markets in home mortgages, the GovernmentNational Mortgage Association, GNMA, and the Federal Home LoanMortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the mainsupporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believeit would allow private lenders to compete more effectively inrural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system,traditionally the largest lender to farmers.</sentence>
		<sentence>A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sellhigh-quality loans on farmland to "poolers," who in turn wouldpackage the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities forresale to investors -- called Aggie-mae by some proponents.</sentence>
		<sentence>The FCA and financially-troubled farm credit system have inthe past been ambivalent about the idea, mainly because anyfarm secondary market established in the private sector whichexcluded the farm credit system would put the system at acompetitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow tothe system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years,Naylor and farm credit system officials have said.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the system and FCA have become more positive tothe idea recently because the system could benefit if it wereappointed the agent for a secondary market.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the poolsof farm mortgage loans, it would benefit from the fees chargedfor providing this service," the Life Insurers' study said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Congressional sources believe a secondary market availableto both private lenders and the farm credit system, with thesystem as agent, could be included in a major federalgovernment rescue package for the system to be drafted byCongress later this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of thesecondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers,concludes that the farm credit system's market share in rurallending would fall if a secondary market were established.</sentence>
		<sentence>The study was released earlier today.</sentence>
		<sentence>The study said a secondary market could be established withvirtually no federal money if the government provided aguarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a privateco-insurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses.</sentence>
		<sentence>It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of theeight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each yearwould qualify for the secondary market in the first few years,expanding significantly later as investors accept the idea.</sentence>
		<sentence>The study also said interest rates charged to farmers whomeet the underwriting standards of a secondary market wouldfall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market.</sentence>
		<sentence>The possible interest rate declines are a major reason whyleading U.S. farm organizations such as the American FarmBureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea.</sentence>
		<sentence>Proponents say a secondary market also would increaseliquidity in farm lending, and spread the risk of such loans.</sentence>

		<sentence>CitiCorp <CCI> appears to be diggingin its heels for tough negotiations over the billions ofdollars in loans that Brazil owes to money center banks, WallStreet analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I view it as pre-negotiation posturing," said analystCarole Berger of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc, referring to bothBrazil and Citicorp.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil recently stopped paying interest onits commercial bank debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Today, CitiCorp said its firstquarter income would be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after tax if itlists the loans as non-performing status.</sentence>
		<sentence>Citicorp filed an 8-K form with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, indicating a material change in its financialsituation.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Citicorp is saying  you can't scare us withthreats, we'll make your loans non-performing right now,"Berger said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The loans have to be treated as non-performing after 90days without a payment.</sentence>
		<sentence>CitiCorp said only that the situationwill be reviewed at the end of the current quarter.</sentence>
		<sentence>Berger asserted that Brazil is doing its own politicking bytalking to U.S. regulators and trying to drive a wedge betweenU.S. and European banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Merrill Lynch and Co said it isunlikely the situation will be resolved until the second halfof this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Ultimately the Brazilians are going to have to pay up onall the interest they owe," Cohn said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The real issue is therescheduling of debt terms.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another question is whether or not the InternationalMonetary Fund can help Brazil with a new austerity program.</sentence>
		<sentence>Stocks of money center banks were mostly down fractions inlate dealings.</sentence>
		<sentence>One trader most stocks in the group bounced offtheir lows by midday as investors took the news in stride.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cohn said the bank stocks may be risky until numbers onnon-performing loans are reported for each bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he saidinvestors looking ahead six to 12 months might want to buy atpresent levels for the "tremendous fundamental values" in thegroup.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analyst Robert Gordon of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc saidManufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC) has the greatest exposure toBrazilian loans of any New York bank, in terms of percentage ofearnings.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said his only two recommendations currently amongNew York banks are J.P. Morgan and Co <JPM> and Bankers TrustCo <BT> which happen to have the least exposure.</sentence>
		<sentence>Gordon said his positive opinion on J.P. Morgan and BankersTrust was not merely a response to the fact that the two havelower exposure to Brazilian loans than other banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>In fact he said there's a chance those banks could get moreinvolved in the future.</sentence>
		<sentence>He noted that Morgan has already set upa brokerage subsidiary to deal in loans to less developedcountries.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't see any reason to change full year earningsestimates, said Frederick Meinke, analyst at E.F. Hutton Co.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hethinks the confrontation with Brazil could end in a replay of asituation that occurred with Argentina in 1984 and 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meinke noted that in the case of Argentina the loans becamenon-accruing for a couple of quarters but then when the bankscame to an agreement with Argentina all the back interest waspaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>"What it did was distort the quarterly earnings pattern,"he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said in the case of Brazil write-offs of loans is aworst-case outcome which is highly unlikely.</sentence>
		<sentence>He noted thatBrazil is a country with a diversified economy, going throughsome economic upheaval after the transition from a military toa civilian government.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The countries of Latin America have too much debt relativeto their ability to service it," said John Mason ofInterstate Securities.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We've been fiddling around with theseproblems for five years and the hour is growing late."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said up to now the banks have reduced their spreads, cutinterest rates internally and extended maturities and none ofthese measures has been enough.</sentence>
		<sentence>He expects re-classification ofas much as a third of the loans as non-accruing and he seespartial write downs of some loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nevertheless Mason thinks the money center bank stocks could be poised for a short term rally.</sentence>
		<sentence>A spokesman at First Chicago Corp <FNB> said it ispremature to put Brazil's loans on a cash basis.</sentence>

		<subject>NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING</subject>
		<sentence>A greater than anticipated need,competitive prices and political motivations could be sparkingSoviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officialssaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>As rumors circulated through grain markets today that theSoviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S.corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factorsthat make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely.</sentence>
		<sentence>First, there are supply concerns.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some trade sources saidrecent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain cropbe revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mlnannounced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.</sentence>
		<sentence>A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affectSoviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to theUSSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower itsArgentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mlntonnes, down from 11.5 mln.</sentence>
		<sentence>Argentina corn exports were alsocut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of thisyear's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mlntonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Significant downside potential" still exists for theArgentine crop, the official said, which will decrease theamount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If the Soviet needs are greater than we have beenthinking, then they might need more than what Argentina canprovide during the April to June period," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparkedSoviet buying.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world marketearlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine cornfor 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Sovietsources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This price difference makes American corn competitive,"Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union,told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely causethose prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. cornfutures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices havebottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Finally, some industry sources said that by buying theminimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grainsagreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping toconvince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.</sentence>
		<sentence>In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretaryRichard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheatsubsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out.</sentence>
