		<subject>BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT</subject>
		<sentence>Venezuela and its bank advisorycommittee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms ofa 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed lastFebruary, bankers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>They declined to disclose details because two or threerepresentatives on the panel have still to obtain the approvalof their senior management for the new terms.</sentence>
		<sentence>The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon andcould put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,the bankers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"A number of details have still to be finalized, but thebroad details of the new amortization schedules and interestrates are in place," one senior banker said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easierterms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was dueto make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request thatit make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -and sought a commitment from the banks to finance newinvestment in Venezuela.</sentence>
		<sentence>The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have beengoing on intermittently for several months, follows theannouncement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debtrescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.</sentence>
		<sentence>And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package,including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.</sentence>
		<sentence>While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successesafter the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension lastFriday.</sentence>

		<subject>TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND</subject>
		<sentence>The Tower Commission report, whichsays President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran armsdeal, just about ends his prospects of regaining politicaldominance in Washington, political analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This is certification of incompetence," private politicalanalyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Towerreport made public today.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's as if he went before a professional licensing boardand was denied credentials."</sentence>
		<sentence>In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman JohnTower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republicansenator from Texas, told a press conference, "The presidentclearly did not understand the nature of this operation."</sentence>
		<sentence>The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion inWashington that Reagan is not in full command of thegovernment, was particularly damaging because it was preparedby a board of the Republican president's own choosing.</sentence>
		<sentence>The three-member panel made up of Tower, former NationalSecurity Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of StateEdmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticismfrom a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We're falling by our own hand," said one Republicanpolitical strategist.</sentence>
		<sentence>"What can we say except 'we're sorry, wewon't do it again'?"</sentence>
		<sentence>The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, saidthe report was like "an anvil falling on us."</sentence>
		<sentence>Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy studygroup, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes ofregaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress,the press and the Washington bureaucracy.</sentence>
		<sentence>The report may also undermine the standing of DefenseSecretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State GeorgeShultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keepingtheir own skirts clean than supporting the president.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They protected the record as to their own positions on thisissue.</sentence>
		<sentence>They were not energetic in attempting to protect thepresident from the consequences," it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former CentralIntelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strongcriticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.</sentence>
		<sentence>Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savagedfor allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iraninitiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.</sentence>
		<sentence>Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerousbrain tumor in December, had already resigned for healthreasons last month.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This is a story about people who came up somewhat short ofbeing heroes," Tower told reporters.</sentence>
		<sentence>While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,including command of the armed forces and the right to vetolegislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him toretake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularlywith Congress controlled by the Democrats.</sentence>
		<sentence>The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether theman in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although his job approval rating has fallen as much astwenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the armsdeal with Iran became public last November, his personalpopularity is still relatively high.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showedthat just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was incontrol of the government, but 55 pct still thought he wasdoing a good job as president.</sentence>
		<sentence>American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, aDemocrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington powerbrokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In the past, he has been able to go around the power eliteby appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televisedaddress next week.</sentence>
		<sentence>But one top Republican strategist warned against expectinga dramatic turnaround.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The White House has to avoid building expectations thatcannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They have to recognize there is no quick fix."</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularityhas not always translated into public backing for his policies.</sentence>
		<sentence>They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November'selections when voters rejected his appeals and restored controlof the Senate to the Democrats.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. DATA POINT TO CAPITAL SPENDING SLOWDOWN</subject>
		<sentence>A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. Januarydurable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spendingthat could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economyin the first quarter of 1987, economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the reportpainted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.</sentence>
		<sentence>But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be aprimary factor behind the drop in orders for business capitalinvestment.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said DavidWyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because itmay be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely totax reform than we thought."</sentence>
		<sentence>The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pctdecline in new orders for machinery was led by declines inoffice and computing equipment orders.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been aresponse to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and theend of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, sopeople just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforcedthe view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December'sincreased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported0.9 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was causedby more than tax reform.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The wash-out that took place in January was far greaterthan the actual gains that took place in November andDecember," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Theeconomy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."</sentence>
		<sentence>"The report definitely points to very sluggish capitalspending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maudeof Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs asevidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving.</sentence>
		<sentence>InNovember, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December theyfell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, whichmay quickly translate to a drop in production," MidlandMontagu's Maude said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made ofJanuary's report, given that other reports have reflectedstrength.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline inDecember.</sentence>
		<sentence>He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in Januaryshipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed totighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numberslike this.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Fed will wait and see," he added.</sentence>

		<sentence>Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largestpublishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a newdaily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, presidentPierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebecgovernment's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company <DonohueInc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new papermill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I would say we will move (ahead with the daily)....</sentence>
		<sentence>Thisis not definite but i think we will," he said, adding that heplans to announce a decision early next week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs lastyear and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three dailynewspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, thesecond-largest circulation paper in Canada.</sentence>
		<sentence>A new daily would give Montreal its second English-language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the citythe most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in NorthAmerica, analysts have said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new Englishlanguage tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within sixmonths.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said he is waiting to determine whether the newventure would have the support of major advertisers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads oftwo major Canadian companies who are interested in the projectbut has not decided whether he would take partners in thenewspaper venture.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said he would consider launching the newspaper with oneof the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It would be the possibility of doing something else in theshort term," Peladeau said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with RobertMaxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc <BPCL.L>does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects.</sentence>
		<sentence>Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stakein Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of thegovvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and Britishprinting acquiring the other 49 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>"In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage ofnewsprint.</sentence>
		<sentence>There were days when we didn't have enough paper toprint the paper," Peladeau said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"When I lived that, I said tomyself...next time we'll be ready."</sentence>
		<sentence>Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprintcapacity however, is already committed to other buyers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a yearand Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirrornewspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies willhave to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or buildanother mill to meet their demands .</sentence>
		<sentence>He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint orother types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could beon stream in two years.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said a mill in Matane, a depressedarea with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by thegovernment.</sentence>
		<sentence>Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventureswith Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market inFrance or in the U.S., where the company owns two largeprinting plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, wouldprovide an entree into the French market, where foreigners areprevented from buying newspapers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Peladeau said he wouldconsider either buying into or starting daily newspapers inFrance or the U.S.    Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain ofabout 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition oftwo groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiatingthe acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada,Peladeau said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the company may consider starting daily newspapersin two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in theprovince.</sentence>

		<sentence>The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's highfloat, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday'sfloat figure was due to holdover and transportation float attwo widely separated Fed districts.</sentence>
		<sentence>For the week as a whole, he said that float related as ofadjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections forunrelated cash letter errors in six districts around thecountry.</sentence>

		<subject>AMERICAN EXPRESS <AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF</subject>
		<sentence>American Express Co remained silent onmarket rumors it would spinoff all or part of its ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may beconsidering such a move because it is unhappy with the marketvalue of its stock.</sentence>
		<sentence>American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as themarket calculated a partially public Shearson may command agood market value, thereby boosting the total value of AmericanExpress.</sentence>
		<sentence>The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financialservices firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.</sentence>
		<sentence>American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.</sentence>
		<sentence>American Express would not comment on the rumors or itsstock activity.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcementyesterday of management changes.</sentence>
		<sentence>At the meeting, company officials said American Expressstock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performanceof Shearson, according to analysts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chiefoperating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position ofpresident, which had been vacant.</sentence>
		<sentence>It also created four newpositions for chairmen of its operating divisions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make mostsense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a totalspinoff.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff ofShearson would be good since it is a strong profit center forAmerican Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings lastyear.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think it is highly unlikely that American Express isgoing to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.</sentence>
		<sentence>He questioned what would be a better investment than "a veryprofitable securities firm."</sentence>
		<sentence>Several analysts said American Express is not in need ofcash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strongasset.</sentence>
		<sentence>But others believe the company could very well ofconsidered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and onerumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.</sentence>
		<sentence>Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said hebelieves American Express could have considered a partialspinoff in the past.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched abig premium in the market place.</sentence>
		<sentence>Shearson's book value is inthe 1.4 mln dlr range.</sentence>
		<sentence>Shearson in the market place wouldprobably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of marketcapitalization," said Eckenfelder.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some analysts said American Express could use capital sinceit plans to expand globally.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They have enormous internal growth plans that takescapital.</sentence>
		<sentence>You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations toenhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down theroad," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavilyin the future, which goes heavily into the internationalarena," said Lewis.</sentence>
		<sentence>"...That does not preclude acquisitions anddivestitures along the way," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to thebrokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock mightbetter reflect other assets, such as the travel relatedservices business.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposureto brokerage.</sentence>
		<sentence>The value of the other components could command ahigher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage ofthe total operating earnings of the company," he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the AgricultureDepartment and the Office of Management and Budget suggeststhat certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO officialtold Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specificrequest of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of thesenate agriculture committee.</sentence>
		<sentence>The report, which will focus on the cost of certificatescompared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.</sentence>
		<sentence>The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends onthe program's impact on the USDA loan program.</sentence>
		<sentence>If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loanentries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost ofthe program would go up.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, if it is determined thatcertificates have caused the government grain stockpile todecrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.</sentence>
		<sentence>GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificatesprogram should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.</sentence>

		<sentence>venezuela is seeking a 'constructive andflexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks toreschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt, finance ministermanuel azpurua told a press conference.</sentence>
		<sentence>He declined to comment on meetings this week in new yorkbetween public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's13-bank advisory committee except to say, "they areprogressing."</sentence>
		<sentence>Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil'sdecision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiateaccording to its own interest.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditorstoday, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct overlibor, azpurua said only, "that is good news."</sentence>
		<sentence>According to banking sources, the banks' latest offer tovenezuela is also a one pct margin as against the lastfebruary's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pctVenezuela wants.</sentence>
		<sentence>Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated withthe banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal paymentsdue in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repaymentschedule, and debt capitalization schemes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs inpublic and private debt principal this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>It was due toamortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay noprincipal on restructured debt this year, but is now insistingthat if it makes payments they be compensated by new bankloans.</sentence>
		<sentence>The banking sources said the committee has been prepared tolower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but thatno direct commitment was likely on new loans.</sentence>

		<sentence>However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelanproposals for a direct link between oil income and debtpayments, "because circumstances change too quickly."</sentence>
		<sentence>At the same time, he said the government is presentlystudying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and privatesector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries.</sentence>

		<sentence>"The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easyas OPEC thought.</sentence>
		<sentence>They may need an emergency meeting to sort outthe problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates, CERA.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPECfaces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>"OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a productionissue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oilanalyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and itsability to keep production under control have given way to apessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon ifit wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>But some other analysts were uncertain that even anemergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC productionabove the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.</sentence>
		<sentence>"OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot havedeemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said theregional manager for one of the major oil companies who spokeon condition that he not be named.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The market is now trying toteach them that lesson again," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPECto meet before June, although not immediately.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, he isnot optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of thewinter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and Aprilwhen demand slackens," Mizrahi said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything morethan reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said that the next two months will be critical forOPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.</sentence>

		<sentence>"Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government andthe time required to restart mothballed terminals will delaythe import until 1988/1989," Daniel Tulis, a natural gasanalyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.</sentence>

		<sentence>"We're going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you,before the Easter recess," Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wantsrecommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, whenCongress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), thesystem's regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA,as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted allits capital and needs federal government help.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of thesystem's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action,he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this yearand perhaps not even in 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>The other Republican member ofthe three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certifyaid is needed, it should request help informally.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We all know we need a capital infusion," Boren said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on theplight of the farm credit system.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also at the hearing, BrentBeesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Councilrepresenting the system, said that at the end of 1986 thesystem had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remainingafter losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years.</sentence>
		<sentence>While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicatedthe situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.</sentence>
		<sentence>"A significant number of banks and associations in the mosteconomically depressed areas have and will continue to sufferextraordinary losses," Beesley said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, saidthe troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of someone billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repayloans.</sentence>
		<sentence>The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs bythe end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year.</sentence>
		<sentence>FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bondsin the system need to be assured their money is safe.</sentence>
		<sentence>Naylorsuggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The bondholders have no worry at this time," Billingtonsaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm creditsystem are circulating.</sentence>
		<sentence>The proposals range from consolidationof the system into a centralized national lender, tode-centralizing into semi-independent institutions.</sentence>
		<sentence>But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious aboutproposals for a secondary market on farm loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>Thoseproposals would package farm loans for resale to investors.</sentence>

		<sentence>Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling ofReagan's worst political crisis since details of the covertarms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguanrebels first emerged last November.</sentence>
		<sentence>But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State GeorgeShultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said theyopposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had beenmuted until the release of the Tower Commission report.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Their obligation was to give the president their fullsupport and continued advice with respect to the program or, ifthey could not in conscience do that, to so inform thepresident," the report said after a three-month probe.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program.</sentence>
		<sentence>They protected the record as to their own positions on thisissue.</sentence>
		<sentence>They were not energetic in attempting to protect thepresident from the consequences of his personal commitment tofreeing the hostages."</sentence>
		<sentence>The report saved some of its most scathing language forRegan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personalfriend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White Houseangered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps moreimportantly, Reagan's wife Nancy.</sentence>
		<sentence>"More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, heasserted personal control over the White House staff and soughtto extend this control to the national security adviser," saidthe report.</sentence>

		<subject>SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS</subject>
		<sentence>Switzerland's economy, combining lowunemployment, financial stability and a large external paymentssurplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactoryfuture, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment, OECD, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>This reflected the success of stable and relatively tightfiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, itsaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked outsome signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up ininflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.</sentence>
		<sentence>The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Productgrowth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct afterlast year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modestincrease in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rateunchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrialnation OECD area.</sentence>
		<sentence>Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs tothe dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pctrise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pctrespectively in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>The faster growth of imports compared with exports thisyear and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meantthat the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDPwould shrink in both years.</sentence>
		<sentence>But "given Switzerland's large external surplus, thereshould be no concern if domestic demand grows faster thanGDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute toimproving international balances," the OECD said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Real private consumption appeared to have been unusuallybuoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after severalyears of relative weakness, it noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhatto a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overallGDP, it added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remainedbright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levelslast year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisationin both the industry and service sectors, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipmentinvestment is likely to decelerate only slightly this yearafter vigorous growth in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects fortourism and the banking industry, two major service sectorearners of foreign exchange.</sentence>
		<sentence>The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and theaccelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, couldlead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Particularly for the banks, "recent developments ininternational financial markets give rise to the questionwhether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantialflexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speedrequired ...

		<sentence>The sharp decline in soybean crush ratiosseen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, haspushed margins below the cost of production at most soybeanprocessing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybeanmeal and oil.</sentence>
		<sentence>The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by theNational Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen overthe past two months when crush margins surged to the bestlevels seen in over a year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushedsoybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in theweekly crush number.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surgein shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the nextfew months.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feeddemand is very light for this time of year due to the milderthan normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices inan attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recentweeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in thenearby March contract today.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and soldMay, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crushtrader said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But they've been bailing out this week because the Marchhas been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if nottomorrow, then later in the month," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crushratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents perbushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last twodays.</sentence>
		<sentence>The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so noprocessors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitablelevel, the trader said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hopefully, they will now start to cutback production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>With futures down, processors are finding they must bidpremiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.</sentence>

		<subject>FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY</subject>
		<sentence>Latest Federal Reserve data suggest thatthe central bank voted to maintain the existing degree ofpressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-makingmeeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think wecan take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing hadchanged," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committeelast Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up totoday."</sentence>
		<sentence>Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed mostfears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip onreserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wantedconfirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which coveredthe two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.</sentence>
		<sentence>This need for additional reassurance was made all the moreacute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves fromthe banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchaseagreements for the first time since April of last year,economists added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Today's data showed that the draining action was for afairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The one thing that caught my eye were the relativelysizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson ofFirst National Bank of Chicago.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But there was a clearlyjustified need for them.</sentence>
		<sentence>There was nothing ominous."</sentence>
		<sentence>"The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the newstatement period today.</sentence>
		<sentence>If it had, it would have missed its(reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no largesingle-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discountwindow, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.</sentence>
		<sentence>For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, thedaily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from160 in the prior period.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday andWednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," saidScott Winningham of J.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Winningham and Co.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Wednesdayaverage rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lending further support to the stable policy view was arelatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in thelatest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves inthe banking system, economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck ofFirst Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein."</sentence>
		<sentence>"Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billiondlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banks' excess reservesaveraged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statementperiod, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.</sentence>
		<sentence>After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth rangeto the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, littleattention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billiondlr jump in the week ended February 16.</sentence>
		<sentence>Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread afine line between the dollar's progress in the internationalcurrency markets and the development of the domestic economy.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect onFed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson.</sentence>

		<subject>FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES</subject>
		<sentence>France's right wing government is facinggrowing pressure to modify its economic policies after revisingdown its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflationforecasts for this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Moving reluctantly into line with most private sectorforecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflationestimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut itseconomic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget lastseptember.</sentence>
		<sentence>Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figureswould not push the government off its chosen mix of pricederegulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they wouldpush to protect the purchasing power of their members, raisingthe spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.</sentence>
		<sentence>And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believedPrime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growthand rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidentialelections due by April 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,"said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We have theimpression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growththis year."</sentence>
		<sentence>"The big question is whether the government's policy of wagemoderation will be maintained," he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for risesjustified by increased productivity.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, EdmondMaire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands alreadyrejected by the government for indexation clauses to be builtinto future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higherprices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Calling the government's policies "unbalanced and unjust," healso demanded investment incentives to boost employment.</sentence>
		<sentence>Heannounced after his meeting that Chirac had told him thegovernment would spend two billion francs on a series ofmeasures to boost employment and training    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderateForce Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chiracearlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest ofFrance's unions, declared the defence of its members earningsits top priority.</sentence>
		<sentence>But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, andstill rising, government supporters and some economic analystssaid they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialistgovernment and I dont think this administration is going toreverse that," commented Michel Develle, economist atrecently-privatised Banque Paribas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmasand the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higherinflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even morethan the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But that would still be an exceptional achievementconsidering that for the first time since the Second World Warall french prices have been freed," he commented.</sentence>
		<sentence>Finance Ministry officials said that the governmentsabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsiblefor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January livingcosts.</sentence>
		<sentence>But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that shouldhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so longas the government kept wages under control.</sentence>
		<sentence>Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally morethan forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,INSEE,  Marais said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the second half year should be better,he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be tohelp the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budgetdeficit, several analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>So long as public sector wages are held down, higher ValueAdded Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset aloss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower thanexpected growth, they said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Japanese life insurers, trust banks andcorporations, largely responsible for vitalising the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bondmarket in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in theU.S., Britain, France and Hong Kong, fund managers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years,Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much onsimilar types of investments, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year maydouble or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Matsumoto, who manages Nikko's investment research andstrategy, said there is evidence Japanese investors beganpoking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year,but few made firm commitments until December when net purchasessuddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in eachof the previous five months.</sentence>
		<sentence>Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to drawthe widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pctof funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets, Matsumoto said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market, firstbecause of its size and next because it has been successfulover the last couple of years," said Eugene Atkinson, managingdirector of Goldman Sachs International Corp.    Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity,enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money inand out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling.</sentence>
		<sentence>They will remain a Japanese mainstay, fund managers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Institutions, particularly life insurance companies whichconcentrate on income rather than capital gains to coverpayouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their U.S.Treasuries, but will put in less money, said Shinichi Kobuse,manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixedincome activities.</sentence>
		<sentence>There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-terminvestors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to asignificant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because theliquidity of the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bond market remains attractive, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S.Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S.Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months.</sentence>
		<sentence>Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reportsof significant growth in earnings by major U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Corporations,he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life InsuranceCo told an economic conference that insurance companies, whichare responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreignsecurities, hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries andintend to diversify into other instruments and currencies.</sentence>
		<sentence>Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of theirfunds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, WestGermany, France and other countries, Hashimoto said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocksrelatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of thestrength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected tooffset currency risks, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pctannual return on overseas investments but the recent decline inU.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fundinvestment stategies.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and Europeanbonds, he said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Domestic demand is now expected to makeno contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for allof the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, he did not say in his speech to the EconomicPlanning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct risein gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly thisfinancial year and net export growth will provide the totalsource of gdp growth.</sentence>
		<sentence>The August budget had forecast domestic demand wouldcontribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.</sentence>
		<sentence>Keating said the overall impact of the changed economicparameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to aslightly more rapid correction in the current account deficitthan first anticipated.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The government initially forecast a current account deficitfor 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is thatthe result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPACin December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy isbroadly on track, Keating said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"They indicate that domestic demand has been a little moresluggish than was expected at budget time," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by morethan expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growthin domestic production and employment."</sentence>
		<sentence>Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflationrate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing ininflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetaryeffects wane," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Keating said the government expects economic growth to pickup moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise innet exports and a very moderate but positive contribution fromprivate domestic demand.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said domestic demand growth will be due to astrengthening in real household disposable income.</sentence>

		<sentence>Talks on the possibility of reintroducingglobal coffee export quotas have been extended into today, withsparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters wasnot included in a key negotiating forum.</sentence>
		<sentence>The special meeting of the International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop aprolonged slide in coffee prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, delegates said no solution to the question of howto implement quotas was yet in sight.</sentence>
		<sentence>World coffee export quotas -- the major device used toregulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement-- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction toa drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds.</sentence>

		<sentence>Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eightproducing countries was not represented in a contact group offive producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates whichwas set up to facilitate debate.</sentence>
		<sentence>The big producers "want to have the ball only in their courtand it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante ofCosta Rica said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotasApril 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quotashares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas beforeSeptember 30, delegates said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazilto retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the exportmarket, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesiasix pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.</sentence>
		<sentence>But consuming countries and the dissident producer grouphave tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determinedby availability, using a formula incorporating exportableproduction and stocks statistics.</sentence>
		<sentence>Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share andColombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quotadistribution scheme into effect now rather than later.</sentence>

		<sentence>Indonesia"s agriculture sector will growby just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pctin 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates ordeclines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.</sentence>
		<sentence>Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast tofall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report onIndonesia"s agricultural performance.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mlntonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because ofa drawdown on stocks.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not lookpromising as rice production is forecast to decline and theproduction of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or nogain," the report says.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The modest overall increase which is expected will be dueto significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oiland palm kernels."</sentence>
		<sentence>Constraints to significant overall increases inagricultural output include a shortage of disease resistantseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance byfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, thereport underlines.</sentence>
		<sentence>The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak ofpests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 whichlargely offset gains in yields.</sentence>
		<sentence>The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are nowresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, moreresistant rice types.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government is depending on increased production ofexport commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood andpalm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crudeoil prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pctin 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports risingto an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, thereport says.</sentence>

		<sentence>Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimateOPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mlnbpd agreed in Geneva last December.</sentence>
		<sentence>They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along withthe much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing abovequota.</sentence>
		<sentence>Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This rumour is baseless.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is based on reports which saidKuwait has the ability to exceed its share.</sentence>
		<sentence>They suppose thatbecause Kuwait has the ability, it will do so," the ministersaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability toproduce up to 4.0 mln bpd.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing theirshare, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpdof its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resistingofficial prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a markerof 18 dlrs per barrel.</sentence>
		<sentence>Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levelsthis year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of19 dollars a barrel.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any internationaloil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices."</sentence>
		<sentence>Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs abarrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil becauseof its local and international refining facilities and its owndistribution network abroad, he added.</sentence>

		<sentence>Gulf money markets have grown reasonablywell during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remainto a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <GulfInternational Bank BSC> (GIB) said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulfcapital markets that investors have to relinquish traditionalinvestment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bankaccounts and precious metals.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled withmore diversified capital market instruments and a change in thedisclosure requirements on company accounts," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The GIB study reviewed capital markets under threecategories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use ofshort-term money market instruments and banks in the region hadfloated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a largeextent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loansand bank facilities and very few companies had made use ofstock or bond issues.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only Kuwait has an official stockexchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establishexchanges.</sentence>
		<sentence>But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capitalmarkets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capitalmarkets in the region."</sentence>
		<sentence>In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,financial awareness among investors is still lacking andinvestment analysis and corporate reporting standards lackdepth.</sentence>
		<sentence>A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s promptedinvestors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.</sentence>
		<sentence>Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in someGulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adoptfinancial innovations had also hampered capital markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporationof joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Azzam said capital market instruments should be madeavailable to all citizens and institutions of Gulf CooperationCouncil (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, SaudiArabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</sentence>
		<sentence>Some moves had beentaken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals toown up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.</sentence>
		<sentence>Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depthfrom the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain andthe expansion of securities repurchase regulations in SaudiArabia.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in SaudiArabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyaldenominated bond issued in 1978.</sentence>

		<sentence>Most managers said they were planning a low issue volumefor the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We want to have a week's pause," one manager said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks,including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank.</sentence>
		<sentence>Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks,from 3.6 billion in January.</sentence>
		<sentence>The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the verybest addresses were having to accept higher coupons.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if youcan give a good coupon," another manager said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But even some government borrowers were not getting thebest reception for bonds which would have been taken up morereadily under other conditions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone,bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside feeson Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows.</sentence>
		<sentence>Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Fridayat 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland's 6-1/2pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price.</sentence>
		<sentence>A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraphand Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within feesat 98.15, 98.50 from its par price.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some shorter maturities did better.</sentence>
		<sentence>In contrast to the10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond forHoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanksmainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The large amount of paper brought to the market in the lasttwo months has also led many syndicate managers to complainabout the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, whichthey say is too inflexible.</sentence>
		<sentence>Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to beregistered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding thetwo-week issue period.</sentence>
		<sentence>A bank may decline to issue a bond onthe requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for thenext calendar period to schedule the bond again.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeksfrom four weeks last July.</sentence>
		<sentence>But few expect the calendar to becompletely abolished.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't think the Bundesbank would givethat up," one banking analyst said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,"the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating thevolume of new issues themselves.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendarwithout trying to regulate the issues, but it needs theregistration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going throughthe euromarket, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbanksacrificing its present calendar system.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndicationdepartments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing tothe carnival holiday.</sentence>

		<sentence>Japanese securities houses will issue newcorporate bonds more quickly, accept issue requests throughoutthe month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitiveunderwriting method from April 1, to bring Japanese firms backto the Tokyo bond market, securities managers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and morecompanies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, butthe proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review ofpublic bond issues, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not onlyto straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds andwarrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseasmarkets," a Nikko Securities house bond manager said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days aftera corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now,the securities managers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuancesystem, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end,and accept issue requests during the month, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Securities houses also plan to introduce free competitionamong underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms inorder to better reflect the market, securities managers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Market participants expect the new issue methods to beapplied beginning in April, with the projected issue by <NipponTelegraph and Telephone Corp>.</sentence>

		<sentence>Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared bysecurities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latestpublic bonds is now almost automatic, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made inlate December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.</sentence>
		<sentence>They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bondmarket, securities house managers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securitieshouses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling forcompanies wanting to issue non-collateral straight andconvertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The cut will more than double the number of corporationsable to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straightbonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bond Market Committee of the Securities ExchangeCouncil also recommended introduction of a shelf registrationsystem, more use of corporate ratings systems andsimplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuingprocess, securities sources said.</sentence>

		<sentence>"Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at theend of his administration, which is not only impossible butalso is very irresponsible as a politican," Rei Shiratori,professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon asparliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer,"Shiratori said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members ofparliament have spoken against the tax, which Nakasone says isneeded to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDPmembers who oppose the tax.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There are some who are objectingbecause of their constituencies," he told a meeting ofgovernment and party leaders.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If the party discipline isbroken, I would like to see punishment considered."</sentence>
		<sentence>"A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partlybecause Nakasone breached his election pledge againstintroducing it," Shiratori said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feelsuncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen'sappreciation and about the future when the Japanese society israpidly aging," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Political analysts said the controversial tax could affectthe more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for April,involving governors, mayors, town and village heads andassemblies at all levels.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the situation is complicated, since opposition partiesexcluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates withthe LDP, the political analysts added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Shiratori said, "In the worst case, implementation of thesales tax, now scheduled for next January, may be put off forsome time before the government makes a final decision.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct toperhaps three pct.</sentence>

		<sentence>They told Reuters the presence of <United Coconut PlantersBank> (UCPB) president Ramon Sy to the board of SMC may meanchanges in SMC management, which for decades was controlled bythe family of its president, Andres Soriano.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sy was appointed by a government commission that controls51 pct of San Miguel's stock, after another nominee resigned.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) holdssix seats on the 15-member SMC board, which represent 33.13 mlnsequestered shares.</sentence>
		<sentence>The stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned byEduardo Cojuangco, then chairman of UCPB and San Miguel.</sentence>
		<sentence>He wasa close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos, and heleft the country after Marcos's fall.</sentence>
		<sentence>Before the seizure, Soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid forthe shares, paying UCPB a 500 mln peso deposit.</sentence>
		<sentence>The bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos.</sentence>

		<sentence>UCPB, however, sought board representation before Sy'sappointment, petitioning the PCGG "so that the interests of theowners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected."</sentence>

		<sentence>The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending March, is56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate ofa record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87.</sentence>
		<sentence>The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based onwholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists pointed out that the government itself hadexpressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87economic survey report published last week.</sentence>
		<sentence>Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, PrimeMinister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed totrim large non-development expenditures.</sentence>
		<sentence>The deficit for1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, hesaid.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTERITY MEASURES IN HUNGARY</subject>
		<sentence>Hungary is to embark on a new series ofausterity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripledlast year after quadrupling in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved byParliament last December was 43.8 billion forints.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Zoltan Boesze, chief of the Finance Ministry's budgetfinancing division, told Reuters the government now saw this astoo high and had decided "quite severe" measures were needed.</sentence>
		<sentence>"All the organizations of economic management have beencharged with elaborating further (savings) measures," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked if these measures were being taken under pressurefrom the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boesze said: "TheFund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results,and of course the Fund would support these efforts."</sentence>
		<sentence>IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's statebudget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints lastyear from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984.</sentence>
		<sentence>The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forintsbecause of poor performance by state firms, which neededsubsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency.</sentence>
		<sentence>The exact extent and nature of savings are still underdiscussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largestbudget item -- must definitely fall, Boesze said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain lowconsumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up theformer situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,"Boesze said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The central administration must be hard.</sentence>
		<sentence>...</sentence>
		<sentence>If weare not hard then we will not be successful."</sentence>
		<sentence>Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserveprovisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I believethese reserves should not be used at all," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domesticproduct, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>The authorities had already signalled a small fall in realwages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe taxpenalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retailprice inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1.</sentence>
		<sentence>About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significantcuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations madethis difficult.</sentence>
		<sentence>But he added: "I think ultimately we will be able to makecurtailments in subsidies in this area as well."</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at thebeginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation andvalue added tax.</sentence>
		<sentence>The IMF supports these aims.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in anattempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms.</sentence>
		<sentence>Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to beunemployed at least temporarily by 1990.</sentence>
		<sentence>Labour discipline isbeing tightened and firms may fire workers more easily.</sentence>
		<sentence>Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the stateby firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises toshed labour.</sentence>
		<sentence>He gave no exact figures.</sentence>
		<sentence>Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsiblefor drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hopedthe law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest singlebudget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approvedfor 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion).</sentence>
		<sentence>Interest payments on international debt are set to rise tomore than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and sevenbillion in 1986, Boesze said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last yearto 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, whiletrade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of morethan 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two yearsearlier.</sentence>
		<sentence>Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pctby credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10pct by the issue of domestic state bonds.</sentence>
		<sentence>Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarianeconomists in a speech this month that the country's economywas in a "very difficult" situation, but not in crisis.</sentence>
		<sentence>There would have to be a turnround with tangible resultsthis year, however, and borrowing must be used moreeffectively.</sentence>

		<subject>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ITALIAN BOOM</subject>
		<sentence>Italy's strong economic revival has ledsome observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in somequarters about future growth prospects, but many Italianexperts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think all this foreign interest in the so-called Italianmiracle is really exaggerated...Foreign observers alwaysoscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism andunwarranted optimism," says Luigi Spaventa, one of Italy'sleading economists and a professor at Rome University.</sentence>
		<sentence>According to Spaventa, these violent swings of mood havebeen occurring for the last 15 years, with Italy one minuteseen as the "bad boy of Europe" and unable to raise a dollar andthe next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration,    "I think there's a lot of exaggeration...Once it used to bethe underground economy and all the correspondents of foreignnewspapers flocked to Italy to study this.</sentence>
		<sentence>That was anotherstory about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a darkroom."</sentence>
		<sentence>Spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialistshere, stress Italy's recent achievements, particularly thedramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrialenterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable.</sentence>
		<sentence>Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A.,<FIAT.M> and <ING.</sentence>
		<sentence>C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming, themajor state industries are back in the black after years oflosses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance ofpayments deficits have been slashed.</sentence>
		<sentence>Expectations by someexperts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the world'sfifth largest economy have also boosted optimism.</sentence>
		<sentence>Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what itfeels to be its second-rate status among the majorindustrialised countries.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of thisstatus after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministersfrom the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States,Japan, West Germany, France and Britain.</sentence>
		<sentence>Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated anagreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canadaattend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concernedmanaging the international monetary system.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problemsstill facing its economy, economists and industrialists say.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy,"warns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti.</sentence>
		<sentence>He says that while Italy's recent achievements are indeedcause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be onthe problems still remaining rather than those already solved.</sentence>
		<sentence>The country's huge state sector deficit, high unemploymentand a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the mostworrying problems, experts say.</sentence>
		<sentence>The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billionlire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiralagain, says Carlo Scognamiglio, head of the private Luissuniversity in Rome.</sentence>
		<sentence>Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in adecade in September 1984 and by January this year was runningat 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guaranteeinternational competiveness, economists and industrialists say.</sentence>
		<sentence>And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally lastOctober according to the latest official data.</sentence>
		<sentence>Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 millionpeople seeking work in October 1986, almost 73 pct were agedbetween 14 and 29.</sentence>
		<sentence>Unemployment in the south was running at17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product(GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pctin 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough tocheck rising unemployment.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another problem is Italy's reliance on imported rawmaterials.</sentence>
		<sentence>The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs.</sentence>
		<sentence>This factor actually worked sharply in Italy's favour lastyear, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's tradedeficit to 3,717 billion lire  by year end from 23,085 billionlire in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>But economists say the improvement owes little to anystructural change in the Italian economy and that any reversalof the trend in costs could have serious consequences.</sentence>
		<sentence>If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world's topindustrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarketoperating procedures and encourage firms to supply more qualityinformation about their activities, economists say.</sentence>
		<sentence>Italy has no controls on insider trading.</sentence>
		<sentence>The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movementscontrols -- a European Community directive calls for these tobe dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a lessblinkered attitude and a change in traditional operatingprocedures, economists say.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Even today, if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse, Idoubt I'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in bankswhich would allow me to do that," says Spaventa.</sentence>

		<sentence>Kick off top-leveltrade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides aregrowing increasingly irritated with each other.</sentence>
		<sentence>The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review thewhole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the wayfor American Secretary of State George Schultz's one daystop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.</sentence>
		<sentence>Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action toreduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanesegovernment official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"But we are also frustrated."</sentence>
		<sentence>The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slashspending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.</sentence>
		<sentence>That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,but it will, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progressthat has been made and instead emphasizing the problems thatremain when it talks with Congress.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It would only take five minutes to list theiraccomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied.</sentence>
		<sentence>The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on theeconomic structures of both countries and how they affect thebilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48billion dlrs in Japan's favour.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the following two days, the topics will range frommultilateral trade talks under the auspices of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral tradeproblems as super computers.</sentence>
		<sentence>The structural talks are intended to be free-wheelingdiscussions among senior officials.</sentence>
		<sentence>Tomorrow's topics includesavings and investment issues such as consumer credit andhousing, and the implications of government budget deficits.</sentence>
		<sentence>These talks come at a particularly delicate time for theJapanese government, which is facing increasing domesticpressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy andstimulate the sagging economy by spending more.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention ofboosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.</sentence>
		<sentence>Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the hugeU.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the tradeimbalance.</sentence>
		<sentence>That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Isbuying more imports.</sentence>
		<sentence>Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a drafttrade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserialtrade practices.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It condemns Japan without due process," oneJapanese official said.</sentence>
		<sentence>That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-outbill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Japan is also not totally happy with the administration'strade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocalaccess to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory tradeaction by the U.S., Officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weakbargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade billoverhanging them.</sentence>

		<sentence>A rift has occured among Philippineofficials over debt talks opening tomorrow in New York withEconomic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod accusing the chiefnegotiator of softening his stand to gain a quick agreement.</sentence>
		<sentence>Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin haddecided not to insist on Manila's creditor banks pledging tofund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billiondlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>"He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast aspossible.</sentence>
		<sentence>I'm saying that's very short-sighted," Monsod said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6billion dlrs of the Philippines' total foreign debt of 27.8billion dlrs would ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resourcetransfer in the same period.</sentence>
		<sentence>Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points overthe London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).</sentence>
		<sentence>Monsod said,  "Right now we are saying to the banks, let'sshare the financing burden."</sentence>
		<sentence>Ongpin said last month the country's consultative group ofmultilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growthfacility to bridge the funding gap.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the government and the consultative group wouldmeet annually to gauge financing needs for each year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The aiddonors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked tofinance any gap on a shared basis.</sentence>
		<sentence>He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try topin the banks down on Monsod's proposed growth facility.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Secretary Monsod and I get along famously," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"She talksand I listen but I don't necessarily agree."</sentence>
		<sentence>Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridgingthe financing gap would have aided the government'spump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan.</sentence>
		<sentence>She said if private sector investment continued to be heldback by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and risinginterest rates, the country would fail to achieve its grossnational product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct overthe next six years.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan.</sentence>
		<sentence>How can there be a program if there is no finance?"</sentence>
		<sentence>she said,adding Ongpin's stand was not good for the economy.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It (Ongpin's stand) is going to make it much more difficultfor the economy to attain its growth targets," Monsod said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is goingto press for there is absolutely no reason why they should notbe able to come back (from New York) in a day," she said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Monsod, the government's chief economic planner, stressedManila's policy was growth before debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>She said if the banks refused to lend the new money, thePhilippines should copy Brazil's action last week in freezingall debt repayments.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some ofthe money that you are sending abroad, then of course you havean option," Monsod said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Brazil would not have suspendedpayments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received moreand faster financing from official lending agencies, FinanceMinister Dilson Funaro said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said he would not seek more money from the InternationalMonetary Fund to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year andsaid Brazil's problems could not be solved by IMF intervention.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's a question of why the official lending agencies don'tfinance a little bit more quickly and easily," Funaro toldreporters at the Brazilian Embassy.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments ofmonthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders ifofficial lending agencies had provided more funds, he replied,"Yes, because our country did not receive financing from theseagencies."</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked how long the payment suspension would last, Funarosaid "It all depends on what kind of financing we are going toreceive from the other side."</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil, with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs,stunned the banking community last week by suspending paymentson some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the WorldBank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in thepast four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said the net transfer was hurting the country'scontinued growth and capacity to import goods.</sentence>

		<sentence>Some mechanism has tobe found to finance a country like Brazil," Funaro said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said hewould like to see "automatic" official lending when needed sothat Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves,now reported to be below four billion dlrs.</sentence>

		<sentence>In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson saidthe actions under consideration are an integral part ofAmerican Express' worldwide financial services strategy andthat the two companies have been having both internal andexternal discussions on the matters.</sentence>
		<sentence>American Express said no decision has been reached on thestrategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimatelydecide to follow growth plans already in place.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that thefinancial services giant was considering a spinoff of part ofShearson and there was speculation it may be consideringselling a stake to a Japanese firm.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said thespeculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct ofthe profitable brokerage firm to the public.</sentence>
		<sentence>There was some speculation that American Express had alsoconsidered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan wasconsidered highly unlikely, analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>American Express said in the statement on Sunday that itwill not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesmanwould not go beyond the statement.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company also remainedsilent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove AmericanExpress stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring itto a Friday close at 74.</sentence>
		<sentence>It said it issued the statement on Sunday because asimilar statement was being circulated to employees.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense forAmerican Express to give up a stake in the wholly-ownedbrokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50pct in the last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some analysts said American Express may consider spinningoff part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stockprice does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.</sentence>
		<sentence>Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>American Express' ambitious plans for international growthmay be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out partof Shearson would bring.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts speculated that all ofShearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.</sentence>
		<sentence>"(American) Express is in a position where they can raisecapital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder ofPrudential-Bache Securities.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization ofShearson management Wednesday.</sentence>
		<sentence>Chief operating officer JeffreyLane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.</sentence>
		<sentence>The reorganization also created four new positions forchairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analystsspeculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement doeslittle to clarify last week's market speculation.</sentence>
		<sentence>It doesconfirm, however, that the financial services firm, whichunsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a majoracquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls forgrowth and positioning in the global market competition.</sentence>

		<subject>U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - ASSET-BACK MARKET GROWS</subject>
		<sentence>The U.S. asset-backed debt securitiesmarket, which grew explosively last year, is broadening andinvestment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backeddeals of the year were done by commercial banks," said AnthonyDub, who heads First Boston Corp's asset-backed group.</sentence>
		<sentence>BankAmerica Corp's <BAC> Bank of America unit last weekissued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit cardreceivables via sole manager First Boston.</sentence>
		<sentence>Dub said theoffering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's <RPT>RepublicBank Delaware unit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the bookson that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were moreclosely related to the so-called "cars deals" that raced tomarket last year than were the RepublicBank securities.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit cardreceivables.</sentence>
		<sentence>In contrast, the Bank of America deal was thefirst public offering of credit card receivables because weused a grantor trust vehicle," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificatesthat represent a specified percentage of an undivided interestin the trust, analysts explained.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bank of America certificates were issued by CaliforniaCredit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that singlepurpose, investment bankers pointed out.</sentence>
		<sentence>The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in1992.</sentence>
		<sentence>First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and pricedit at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points overcomparable Treasury securities.</sentence>
		<sentence>Non-callable for life, the dealwas rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's.</sentence>
		<sentence>Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed theBank of America deal was priced too aggressively.</sentence>
		<sentence>"AAA-ratedauto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasurieswhen First Boston priced the deal," one said.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.</sentence>
		<sentence>The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal'stop-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year'scars deals, which were rated by S and P alone.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18months and then interest and principal payments for theremaining five to seven months," Dub detailed.</sentence>
		<sentence>Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank ofAmerica deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, theissue had a longer average life than some of the cars dealsthat were brought to market late last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA creditcard receivables, backed by a letter of credit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bank of Americahas about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, makingit one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray intothe young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted.</sentence>
		<sentence>In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via CaliforniaCars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backedby automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc.

		<sentence>After a week that left his presidencyshaken and his popularity at a new low, Ronald Reagan and hisnew chief of staff today begin trying to revive anadministration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker,whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisanpraise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathingcriticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms withIran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon.</sentence>
		<sentence>Among the chores facing Reagan's new inner circle isassessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report hasdone to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Caseyas the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency.</sentence>
		<sentence>White House officials are checking to see how much supportGates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would haveif his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote,Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Appearing on the NBC News program, "Meet the Press," theKansas senator said the Gates nomination "could be in somedifficulty."</sentence>
		<sentence>Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priorityby Baker.</sentence>
		<sentence>Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms salescandal, lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gatesnomination is not assured and, even if won, would come onlyafter months of congressional probes into the affair.</sentence>
		<sentence>"He has the smell of Iran on him," said former Nevada Sen.and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt.</sentence>
		<sentence>"He is a victim."</sentence>
		<sentence>Laxalt, appearing on the ABC News program, "This Week WithDavid Brinkley," bluntly admitted "the Gates nomination is introuble."</sentence>
		<sentence>Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn saidthe odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates.</sentence>
		<sentence>When asked on the syndicated television program, "JohnMcLaughlin: One on One," if he thought Gates would be confirmed,the Georgia Democrat shot back: "I wouldn't bet any money on it.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I think this report hurts that," Nunn said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It indicatesthat the National Security Council had policy-type influenceover intelligence-type activities and we're going to go intothat with Mr. Gates.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only a day after it was issued last week, the Tower reportprompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chiefof staff.</sentence>
		<sentence>Regan, the former Wall Street executive and Treasurysecretary who has been the president's top aide for the pasttwo years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for thebotched handling of the Iran arms sale.</sentence>
		<sentence>The report blamed Regan for the "chaos that descended on theWhite House" since it was first revealed last November thatprofits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contrarebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government.</sentence>
		<sentence>The two other victims of the scandal are former NationalSecurity Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned andMarine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it wasdisclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms salewere diverted to the contras.</sentence>
		<sentence>The two, pictured by the Towercommission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal, haverefused to testify.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayedin the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whoseinattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>That perception has wrecked Reagan's popularity andthreatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leavesoffice in January 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence>A recent Newsweek magazine poll foundthat just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan's leadership,a record low, and a third believed he should considerresignation.</sentence>
		<sentence>After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring overthe meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen.John Tower, Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide televisionaddress this week to respond to the criticisms of hispresidency.</sentence>

		<subject>BRAZIL CRITICISES ADVISORY COMMITTEE STRUCTURE</subject>
		<sentence>Brazil is not happy with the existingstructure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinatesits commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committeewhile holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said,adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."</sentence>
		<sentence>The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,however.</sentence>
		<sentence>Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese andEuropean banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adoptan approach involving separate discussions with the regions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on acase-by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply tocreditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interestpayments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followedlast week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines depositedby foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week inWashington talking to government officials and internationalagencies and will this week visit Britain, France, WestGermany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions withgovernments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe andGovernor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.</sentence>
		<sentence>Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K.</sentence>
		<sentence>The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.</sentence>
		<sentence>The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chiefmeans of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharplyand the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in thecountry'sate of inflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Reserves were reported to havedropped below four billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problemswith Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve onlypartial servicing of the debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>"What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinancefor part of the service, because we cannot service all that," hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I really think we have to change the old rules."</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, ratherthan the commercial banks themselves in its search for asolution to the crisis, Funaro said "We must first talk to thegovernments and then we can talk to the banks, because thebanks have some limits."</sentence>
		<sentence>"It is a political discussion from our point of view," hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk toJapanese and Canadian government officials.</sentence>
		<sentence>He would then talkto the commercial banks "If I've got some solution from thegovernments.</sentence>
		<sentence>I can't take the burden only to the banks."</sentence>
		<sentence>He wasnot sure how long it would take to reach a solution.</sentence>
		<sentence>  In discussions with governments Brazil would review themechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations inneed.</sentence>
		<sentence>Finance from official lending agencies had been virtuallyclosed since 1982.</sentence>
		<sentence>"You must open these mechanisms," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed byBrazil's suspension of interest payments, they understoodBrazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.</sentence>
		<sentence>Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed "becausewe can't stay as we were the last few years."</sentence>
		<sentence>"I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of uswould like to have a kind of equilibrium."</sentence>
		<sentence>he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>AlthoughBrazil has rejected a substantive role for the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a callin Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and toWorld Bank President Barber Conable.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro noted that inflation in February had started todecline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eightbillion dlr trade surplus in 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus haddeclined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of lastyear, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months.</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world,Funaro said, although its share of international trade was onlyone pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The solution is linked with growth, not recession," hesaid, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports andinducing an internal recession in order to service debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments,as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounderstructure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Clubof creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.</sentence>

		<sentence>European Community steelmakerspresented the Executive Commission with a controversial planfor the future of the industry which diplomats say it may beforced reluctantly to accept.</sentence>
		<sentence>Under the plan steel output would remain subject torestrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled foryears to come while steel firms undertook a massiveslimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.</sentence>
		<sentence>Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed theending of the quota system by December 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence>He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EClaw is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis."</sentence>
		<sentence>But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss thisidea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis intheir countries, with orders falling as customers switch toalternative products and accounts firmly in the red.</sentence>
		<sentence>Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries arelikely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back theindustry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising thepolitical impact of plant closures, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by theEC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quotaproduction system at least until the end of 1990.</sentence>
		<sentence>Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for itidentified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis toreduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, thatof hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.</sentence>

		<sentence>Directors of the Chicago MercantileExchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petitionasking the exchange to tighten rules covering tradingactivities in the widely-popular Standard and Poor's 500 StockIndex futures pit, an exchange executive said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legalpractice where traders execute customer orders as well as tradefor their own account.</sentence>
		<sentence>But exchange officials noted this practice also provides anopportunity for a trader to engage in what is called"front-running", where traders enter orders for their own accountbefore executing orders for their customers.</sentence>
		<sentence>Leo Melamed, CME special counsel, said directors will ruleon the petition on Wednesday, but added that a special S and PAdvisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futurestrading conditions for the last six months and is expected tosubmit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days.</sentence>
		<sentence>In addition to a recommendation on dual trading, Melamedsaid the special committee will also make suggestions about apossible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that wouldalleviate congested conditions in the trading pit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Melamed said directors are likely to approve therecommendations of the special committee because "most actionsof the board are in line with committee recommendations."</sentence>
		<sentence>CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the boardaccepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will besubmitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission forapproval.</sentence>
		<sentence>If the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request,a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membershipfor a vote within 15 days, Beyer said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled onbefore the recommendations from the special committee are made"it will confuse the issue."</sentence>
		<sentence>Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrictdual trading.</sentence>
		<sentence>Although Jonathan Wolff, senior vice president at DonaldsonLufkin and Jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on mostexchanges.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It's a question of the integrity of the person you dobusiness with," Wolff said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain thattrading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make upfor errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders inchaotic futures trading pits.</sentence>
		<sentence>"To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficultfor a broker to function because of his errors," said JohnMichael, vice president at First Options of Chicago.</sentence>
		<sentence>"What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved,"he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokeragemakes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), oreven suspected him of doing it, I would cut him off," Michaelsaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit, forinstance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a dayat 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Even figuringwhat is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors suchbrokerage can be lucrative.</sentence>

		<sentence>Robert Lutz, executive vice president, told a newsbriefing: "After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is aboutto re-enter the European market.</sentence>
		<sentence>And we are here to stay."</sentence>
		<sentence>Michael Hammes, vice president of international operations,said Chrysler planned to market "a few hundred vehicles" by yearend.</sentence>
		<sentence>"By the end of 1988, we hope to reach 5,000."</sentence>
		<sentence>The first carswould be sold in West Germany, Austria and Switzerland, hesaid.</sentence>
		<sentence>The European base would be in West Germany, but no finaldecision had been made on other sites.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company will not set up its own dealer franchises, butintends to work through distributors who will wholesale thevehicles to a franchised dealer organisation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lutz commented, "We prefer to export to Europe rather thanmanufacture here because it will allow us to take fullcompetitive advantage of the favourable exchange rates due tothe declining value of the dollar."</sentence>
		<sentence>The vehicles, on show at this week's Geneva motor show,include Chrysler LeBaron Turbo coupe and convertible, the DodgeLancer ES four-door hatchback, the Dodge Shadow ES compact, thePlymouth Voyager miniwagon and the Dodge Daytona Shelby Z.    Chrysler is aiming for the mainstream European buyer, whoappreciates sporty cars with 2.2 litre engines, officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Prior to negotiating a loan guarantee program with the U.S.Government in 1978, Chrysler sold its European operations toPeugeot SA <PEUP.P>.</sentence>
		<sentence>Chrysler now owns 24 pct of MitsubishiMotors Corp <MIMT.T> and 15 pct of <Maserati>, which may serveas European distribution channels in future, Hammes said.</sentence>

		<sentence>More than two mln tonnes of surplus maizedotted across Zimbabwe in huge piles is posing an economicheadache for the country.</sentence>
		<sentence>The grain, Southern Africa's staple, has been bought by theGrain Marketing Board (GMB) at prices guaranteed before it wasplanted, and is costing the GMB about 27 mln dlrs a month instorage and interest payments to make the purchases.</sentence>
		<sentence>Accumulated over the past two years of bumper harvests, thesurplus represents about two years of domestic consumption andis set to grow as further deliveries are due shortly.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some deals have been made with aid donors, such as Europeancountries and Australia, to provide Zimbabwe with wheat inreturn for maize sent to neighbouring Mozambique, where theUnited Nations has urged greater world efforts to feed thehungry.</sentence>
		<sentence>But transport constraints keep those figures low and theonly significant dent was a sale of 250,000 tonnes to SouthAfrica last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Because of the costs it has incurred, the GMB cannot affordto give the maize away and the standard 90 kg bags have beenaccumulating, economists here said.</sentence>
		<sentence>But failure to find buyers on glutted world grain marketsis damaging Zimbabwe, as it needs foreign exchange to financeimports for other areas of the economy, the economists added.</sentence>
		<sentence>"At present, it is a no-win situation.</sentence>
		<sentence>Let us hope some ofthe extra aid (UN) Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellarcalled for at the weekend will be spent here," a Western aidspecialist said.</sentence>

		<subject>TECHNOLOGY/CHIP INDUSTRY SEEKS CUSTOM DESIGNS</subject>
		<sentence>U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,struggling to stem a river of red ink, are increasingly lookingtoward customized designs rather than mass-market chips forfuture profits.</sentence>
		<sentence>The market for customized chips - semiconductors designedfor a very specific application or product - is expected toexpand by 25 to 30 pct this year, compared with only about sixpct for the entire integrated circuit industry.</sentence>
		<sentence>Market researcher Dataquest Inc estimates that sales ofcustomized chips totaled about 4.5 billion dlrs worldwide lastyear, about 12 pct of the total chip market.</sentence>
		<sentence>By 1990, however,customized chips are expected to represent a 12 billion to 15billion dlr market, about 25 pct of total chip sales.</sentence>
		<sentence>More important for their vendors, because they are not astandard design customized chips represent a sellers' market,and prices and profit margins can be set accordingly.</sentence>
		<sentence>High volume memory chips have become "a perfect commoditymarket," Robert Brodersen, a professor of electricalengineering at the University of California at Berkeley, toldan industry forum.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The product is interchangeable between one manufacturerand another and customers base their buying decisions almostentirely on price," Brodersen said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He predicted that, in the next few years, only a handful ofthe world's largest chip manufacturers (most of them Japanese)will produce memory chips, the standard electronic componentfound in everything from digital watches to computers.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Therest of the industry just won't be involved."</sentence>
		<sentence>Last week's International Solid State Circuits Conference,the chip industry's annual forum for new developments, seemedto support Brodersen's prediction.</sentence>
		<sentence>Of the 116 papers presented at the conference, some 40 pcthad Japanese authors, the first time they have outnumberd theUnited States.</sentence>
		<sentence>Most of the Japanese chip designs were in thememory category, including Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Co'sattention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory(dram) chip, 16 times more powerful than anything nowavailable.</sentence>
		<sentence>The most advanced memory chip described by a U.S. companywas International Business Machine Corp's <IBM> four mln bitchip, and IBM only manufactures chips for its own internal use,not for the open market.</sentence>
		<sentence>The problem with memory chips is that they are all based onthe same, well known design standards, so they are easy to copyand inexpensive to manufacture.</sentence>
		<sentence>Because such large Japaneseconglomerates as Sony Corp <SNE>, NEC Corp, <NIPNY> Matushitaand Mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronicsproduct lines, they also have a guaranteeed internal market fortheir chips, so they can produce huge amounts at a very lowcost per unit.</sentence>
		<sentence>Customized chips, however, are designed for a specificcustomer, manufactured in small quantities and expensiverelative to standard chips.</sentence>
		<sentence>Computer markets are increasinglylooking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy,thus making the final product harder to clone as well.</sentence>
		<sentence>Intel Corp <INTC>, the leading manufacturer of themicroprocessors that form the brains of most computers, alertedthe industry to its intention to switch to customized chipslast fall.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company, which just reported a loss for 1986, said itwill spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itselfinto a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips.</sentence>
		<sentence>Intel joins some 275 companies already competing for apiece of the customized chip business but it has an advantagethat the others do not.</sentence>
		<sentence>IBM, which owns a 20 pct stake inIntel, has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15,000chips it makes for its own use.</sentence>
		<sentence>Intel will customize thosedesigns and sell them to others.</sentence>
		<sentence>It will also get to use IBM's proprietary computer systemfor designing chips, considered by experts to be one of themost advanced in the world.</sentence>
		<sentence>Intel's success is still not guaranteed, however.</sentence>
		<sentence>Industryanalysts noted that it is far different to design a mass marketitem than a customized chip that requires a close workingrelationship with the customer.</sentence>
		<sentence>Intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing itsnewest 30386 microprocessor.</sentence>
		<sentence>A much faster turnarouond time,and much lower development costs, will be required forcustomized chips if the firm is to succeed.</sentence>

		<sentence>American Motors Corp said it will takesteps to build a proposed new jeep vehicle at an unspecified"alternative location" after the weekend breakdown of talkswith the United Automobile Workers union on a concessionarycontract covering workers at AMC's Wisconsin operations.</sentence>
		<sentence>AMC spokesman Lloyd Northard told Reuters that the companywill not build its new Jeep ZJ sports utility vehicle at itsKenosha, Wisc., assembly plant as a result of the talks'failure.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We sincerely regret this outcome, but the responsibilityfor it rests entirely with the local union bargainingcommittees," the company said in a statement.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We will, therefore, initiate the actions necessary toplace the new Jeep product in an alternative location ratherthan at Kenosha."</sentence>
		<sentence>UAW officials said during the weekend they did not regardthe collapse of talks as final after the company's "final"proposal on a new contract was unanimously rejected by unionbargainers.</sentence>
		<sentence>But AMC said the union's rejection of its concessionspackage means that plants in Kenosha and Milwaukee will lose6,500 jobs because the assembly complex in Kenosha "will not begetting new work" as had been proposed with a new contract.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This unfortunate outcome demonstrates the difficulty ofmaintaining existing working and bringing new work to existingU.S. operations," AMC said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Asked if the company considered the decision to phase outthe Kenosa plant by 1989 as previously detailed to be final,Northard said: "If the union came to us and said they wouldaccept our final proposal, that's another matter."</sentence>
		<sentence>But the company charged bargainers for UAW Locals 72 and 75had reneged on commitments for a new agreement with lower laborrates made in 1985 when the union locals negotiated aconcessionary agreement covering AMC's Wisconsin operations.</sentence>
		<sentence>AMC, which last week reported its first profitable quarterin two years, said it wanted a contract for the plants withlabor rates and work rules comparable to agreements between theUAW and Japanese automakers operating in the U.S.    Wall Street investors reacted to the AMC-UAW impasse bydriving down AMC's stock price.</sentence>

		<sentence>The major U.S. Government bond brokersare likely to give in to pressure from regulators and investorswithin the next 18 months, making their direct-dealing screensavailable to many of those firms that are not now eligible toreceive them, said Richard Lacy, Chairman of Exco InternationalInc.</sentence>
		<sentence>Earlier today, Exco said it purchased an 80 pct interest inRMJ Holdings Corp, one of the largest of the four bond brokersthat dominate the business.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a telephone interview, Lacy said "Within 18 months, wethink the number of players will be expanded."</sentence>
		<sentence>Currently, the four major brokers will sell theirdirect-dealing screens to only primary dealers in U.S.Government securities or those that have applied to the FederalReserve Bank of New york to become a primary dealer.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S. Justice department is looking into whetherlimiting access to the screens to just a small group of dealersis a violation of U.S. Anti-trust laws.</sentence>
		<sentence>Primary dealers, of which there are now 40, are an elitegroup of firms approved to buy Treasury securities directlyfrom the Fed.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Lacy said that any agreement to expand access to thebrokers' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not asfar-reaching as some would like.</sentence>
		<sentence>Instead of making screensavailable to any firm willing to pay for one, he said, it ismore likely that a "second tier" will be established.</sentence>

		<sentence>Bond market sources had speculated that RMJ is betterprepared to offer its services nationwide than its three majorcompetitors.</sentence>

		<subject>TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL <VIA></subject>
		<sentence>A bidding war for Viacom InternationalInc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted amanagement group and other investors against NationalAmusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.</sentence>
		<sentence>Both sides raised their bids over the weekend.</sentence>
		<sentence>A sourceclose to the management side insisted that timing was on hisside.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said if outside directors approve the managementproposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholderswith proxy material going out late this week.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It would take 20days from the day we mail," said the source.</sentence>
		<sentence>The source predicted National Amusements, controlled byinvestor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to completea tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that mustaccompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licensesand cable television franchises.</sentence>
		<sentence>Redstone was not available for comment.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a raresituation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war.</sentence>
		<sentence>Onesaid Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted andif enough people were convinced his proposal was superior tothe Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.</sentence>
		<sentence>The independent directors of Viacom were called into ameeting today.</sentence>
		<sentence>Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.</sentence>
		<sentence>Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon.</sentence>
		<sentence>Onemajor Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We thinkwe're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm'sarbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.</sentence>
		<sentence>Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal wouldcreate a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt.</sentence>
		<sentence>Themanagement plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferredstock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.</sentence>
		<sentence>Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with avalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stockstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equityinterest in the restructured Viacom.</sentence>
		<sentence>One arbitrageur calculatedthe equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making thetotal package worth 52 dlrs per share.</sentence>
		<sentence>Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeablepreferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share ofconvertible preferred.</sentence>
		<sentence>The arbitrageur said the equity portionwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest hewould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyondApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated.</sentence>
		<sentence>Theplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pctduring May and 12 pct thereafter.</sentence>
		<sentence>Previously Redstone offeredeight pct interest.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the managementgroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,were offering high prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Redstone really wants to own thecompany," one said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another said management seemed to have theedge on the timing issue.</sentence>
		<sentence>Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.</sentence>
		<sentence>A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine whatthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth.</sentence>
		<sentence>Henoted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, whichadopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititallytraded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is nowjust over 30 dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell twotwo cts per share from 23 cts.</sentence>
		<sentence>The company said interest costsfrom several acquisitions affected results.</sentence>
		<sentence>Shares of Warner Communications Inc <WCI> rose 7/8 to31-1/8.</sentence>

		<sentence>Canada's decision to raise the issueof a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many seeas a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policystudy group said     "It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period,when it was a major player in the process of building a postwarworld," the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summeraimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries,the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipmentsof about 150 billion dlrs annually.</sentence>
		<sentence>The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadlineof October for an agreement, are the biggest issue inU.S.-Canadian relations.</sentence>
		<sentence>The study said liberalized trade between the two countrieswould improve the competitiveness of their economies in worldmarkets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.</sentence>
		<sentence>The council said "in the past most Canadians have shied awayfrom the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to beoverwhelmed economically and politically by a closerassociation with a country 10 times their size in population."</sentence>
		<sentence>But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized theirdomestic market was too small to permit the mass production andsales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by anincreasingly competitive world.</sentence>
		<sentence>The council said that in the talks, Canada is chieflyinterested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports.</sentence>
		<sentence>A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposedon Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were beingsubsidized.</sentence>
		<sentence>The council said the chief U.S. concerns included endingcurbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, andthe so-called "cultural industries" - publishing, broadcastingand films.</sentence>

		<sentence>Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, thelargest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand itsspecialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and betterits 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We expect to shift our company toward higher value-addedbusinesses and continue to broaden our base," Henderson toldreporters at an informal meeting here.</sentence>
		<sentence>ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S.drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its StuartPharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its currentpharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990.</sentence>
		<sentence>Henderson said, "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost inthe way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not."</sentence>
		<sentence>ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drugmaker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales wereabout 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs,which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits.</sentence>
		<sentence>He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical divisionwould account for about 30 pct of total company profits.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The drug division far and away brings in the highest rateof return," said A.W.</sentence>
		<sentence>Clements, finance director of ICI, whowas also at the meeting.</sentence>
		<sentence>Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basicallyact as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugsto doctors.</sentence>
		<sentence>ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one.</sentence>
		<sentence>Henderson said the major new products in the company'spipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrsannually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications,Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin,a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure.</sentence>
		<sentence>Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvalto market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensingagreements with Merck and Co Inc <MRK>, is not expected untilabout 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence>ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwinin the U.S. later this year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much.</sentence>
		<sentence>Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by GliddenPaints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from aunit of Hanson Industries Inc.    Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrsavailable for acquisitions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year the company made 40acquisitions, the largest being Glidden.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said that moreacquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out anacquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive."</sentence>
		<sentence>Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effectiveApril one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones whowill retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing theearnings momentum ICI has established over the past few yearsafter restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.</sentence>

		<sentence>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaroflatly rejected a U.K.</sentence>
		<sentence>Suggestion that his country seekInternational Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debtnegotiations with commercial creditor banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Talking to reporters, Funaro said this attitude would nothelp resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspendedindefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in externaldebt on February 20.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour ofEuropean capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debtmoratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improvecapital flows between developed countries and third worlddebtor nations.</sentence>
		<sentence>Talking before his departure for Paris, he said there couldbe no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity planafter a similar package four years ago "put Brazil in a very bigrecession."</sentence>
		<sentence>"We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more andimport less.</sentence>
		<sentence>We are not going to go the IMF," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following histalks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, saying theU.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as aproblem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Britain also believed an IMF program would help alongnegotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks, thestatement, which banking sources interpreted as an outrightrebuttal of all Brazilian demands, said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"That was not my impression of the meeting," Funaro said; "Butif the (British) answer is more or less like this, thenthat means nothing is helping to find a solution."</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week andin Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support tounblock lending from official credit agencies, rather than todeal with Brazils ties with commercial banks.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Since 1982, all official agencies have been closed to mycountry," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil'sefforts.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lawson would officially state his position when thetwo meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank springmeetings in Washington, Funaro said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil'sdebt problem to be resolved, Funaro said Brazil had not come toEurope with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme," he said,"We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see whathappens."</sentence>

		<sentence>The recent Australian proposals were a good starting pointfor discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feelthey are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on worldgrain trade, the president of the National Association of WheatGrowers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Wheat Associates saidin a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.</sentence>
		<sentence>Future discussions on international wheat trade shouldinclude three topics -- a commitment to privatization ofgovernment-run export trading entities, a commitment to publicdisclosure of sales and other terms if government entities areinvolved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, thetwo organizations said     While the Australian proposals are welcome the twoorganizations said they are not in total agreement with theirassessments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. targetprices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue toplace the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.farmers, they said.</sentence>

		<sentence>However, the Bass family has not indicated supportone way or the other for his offer, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on theconversations he held with shareholders, he could not guagewhether he had majority support.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said, however, there issupport for his offer.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he helddiscussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medicalstock.</sentence>
		<sentence>Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medicalmanagement and other American Medical shareholders.</sentence>
		<sentence>Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, said it believes a restructuring of AmericanMedical and its business would be "highly desirable andappropriate at this time."</sentence>
		<sentence>"That's the sort of position that I find a large segment ofshareholders of AMI really share," said Pesch.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining histakeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, fourdlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for eachAmerican Medical share.</sentence>
		<sentence>Wedge said it has no plans to join inan effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would notrule out a future takeover try.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposalwith the Bass family.</sentence>
		<sentence>Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch'stakeover effort and a further sign that there could be someshareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical'sprevious rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer fromPesch.</sentence>
		<sentence>American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid.</sentence>
		<sentence>Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said amanagement-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.</sentence>
		<sentence>An American Medical spokesman said the company will commenton the new Pesch offer by March 10.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor inthe outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bass family holds an 11.</sentence>
		<sentence>6 pct stake in AmericanMedical, and the company has previously said the investorssupport management's internal plan to improve the company'sperformance.</sentence>
		<sentence>The Bass family would not comment on AmericanMedical or Pesch.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corplast year, continues to face a credibilty problem on WallStreet because of the long time it took to finish the Republicacquisition.</sentence>
		<sentence>Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wallstreet questioning whether financing can be completed for themuch larger American Medical takeover proposal.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made withoutan investment banking firm, another cause for concern to WallStreet.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, Pesch entered his second offer withrepresentation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securitiesand Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can beworked out and completed, provided we get to the point whereAmi management will sit down and talk in a friendlyenvironment," Pesch said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financingarrangements are being made.</sentence>
		<sentence>He did say if he succeeds inacquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of AmericanMedical management in place.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said he plans to combine the company with Republic toform an efficient network of hospitals.</sentence>
		<sentence>Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer couldbe made for American Medical.</sentence>
		<sentence>Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved secondfiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worthabout 20 dlrs per share.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the secondquarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ctloss last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much morethan the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transactioncould be completed because of the revised structure of theoffer.</sentence>

		<subject>FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS</subject>
		<sentence>French industry is failing to produce thegoods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has leftthe government little room for manoeuvre to reflate theeconomy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment said.</sentence>
		<sentence>With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pctthis year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climbto 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.</sentence>
		<sentence>The report said the French economy was "increasinglyill-adapted to demand" selling goods at "uncompetitive relativeprices on both domestic and export markets."</sentence>
		<sentence>"France's poor export performance reflects a geographicalbias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18months," it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficitto around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against thefranc could lead to "a (renewed) loss of competitivenessrelative not only to the United States but also to the newlyindustrialised countries."</sentence>
		<sentence>This could result in further major losses of market share,particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost aquarter of French exports, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Until the competitive ability of industry improved, theauthorities would have "little scope for macroeconomicmanoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need toencourage a pickup in investment could require demand to growmore briskly," it added.</sentence>
		<sentence>But rising unemployment could help to hold down wagedemands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around atwo pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Written mainly in December last year, the report took noaccount of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pctsurge in January consumer prices, caused partly by thegovernment's deregulation of service sector tariffs.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provokerunaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet hasbeen lost," one OECD official commented.</sentence>
		<sentence>OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oilprices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in thereport, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecastto around 2.5 or three pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government last week revised its forecast up to between2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the OECD backed the government's view that theunderlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year'sfall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause ofdisinflation.</sentence>
		<sentence>With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest inthe OECD area, the inflation differential between France andits main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just onepct this year, it said.</sentence>
		<sentence>On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices forindustrial goods and private services have been rising steeplyas companies built up their profits.</sentence>
		<sentence>"For the disinflationary process to continue , and pricecompetitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchangerate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,"it said.</sentence>

		<subject>REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY</subject>
		<sentence>Last week's White House shake-up hasincreased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman PaulVolcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from thearms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close tothe Fed say.</sentence>
		<sentence>But they said that no decision on the appointment, whichmust be filled this August, has been taken by the White Houseand Volcker too has not made up his mind.</sentence>
		<sentence>Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, whoresigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named ashis replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and triedoften to undermine him.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried toensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by PresidentCarter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked astory, quickly shot down by others in the administration, thatBeryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,had been chosen to replace Volcker.</sentence>
		<sentence>But as the administration's credibility was increasinglyunder fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring aboutsuch changes was on the wane.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said New White House Chief of Staff HowardBaker has a very good relationship with his namesake at theTreasury Department and is likely to respect his views on theFed chairmanship.</sentence>
		<sentence>As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to sharethe right-wing's opposition to Volcker.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This new White House is going to need all the strength itcan get," said one source when asked about the possibility ofVolcker's reappointment.</sentence>
		<sentence>Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets bothin the United States and around the world.</sentence>
		<sentence>At a time when thestability of the dollar and the viability of major debtornations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitelyundermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with TreasurySecretary Baker on issues like international debt and globaleconomic cooperation.</sentence>
		<sentence>The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulatethe banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, inwhich he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,signalled the politically-independent central bank is comingaround at least partially to the Treasury position.</sentence>
		<sentence>And a recent statement by a Reagan administration officialthat the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seenas an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.</sentence>
		<sentence>Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker'sreappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointedTreasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure agood working relationship, in part because he believed the twokey government economic institutions have to work closely.</sentence>
		<sentence>Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's firstterm, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firmMerrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America'spre-eminent economic spokesman.</sentence>
		<sentence>He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose politicalskills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets tookmuch more seriously.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited tostay.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Is the president going to ask him?</sentence>
		<sentence>he wouldn't stayotherwise," said one.</sentence>
		<sentence>"He'd have to be asked," said StephenAxilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fedand now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.</sentence>
		<sentence>Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is notawe-inspiring.</sentence>
		<sentence>And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leavebehind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --the four sitting members were all appointed within the lastthree years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the globaleconomy is threatened by instability.</sentence>
		<sentence>An experienced successor, therefore, would seem anecessity.</sentence>
		<sentence>One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary ofState George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretaryunder Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economistwould make him ideal.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iranscandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37years old as too young for the job.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other potential candidates include economist AlanGreenspan, frequently an informal presidential economicadviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, FederalDeposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.</sentence>
		<sentence>Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged byhis patron's departure from the White House.</sentence>

		<sentence>European Community (EC) farm ministerswere fighting hard early today to prevent a deal on cuttingoverflowing milk production from turning sour before trying toagree widescale reforms in other surplus sectors.</sentence>
		<sentence>Meanwhile, protests from angry European farmers oversuccessive attempts to scale down unwanted Community foodproduction appeared to be gathering strength.</sentence>
		<sentence>In the northeastern Spanish city of Saragossa thousands ofSpanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand abetter deal from Brussels.</sentence>
		<sentence>The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pelletsand occupied local government buildings while in the southerncity of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemonson the streets in protest at EC duties.</sentence>
		<sentence>Towards the end of last week, about 10,000 angry WestGerman farmers marched through the streets of Hanover burningeffigies of Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle while in Francepig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>Europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by theEuropean Commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limitfarmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into publicstores at high guaranteed EC prices.</sentence>
		<sentence>In the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review,at which EC ministers set the levels of subsidies, AgricultureCommissioner Frans Andriessen has included measures that couldresult in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>The plans form part of an on-going campaign to reformsurplus-creating farm policies that have become a politicalembarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad andthreatened to leave the Community with no cash for other areas.</sentence>
		<sentence>Andriessen's latest package comes only months after adecision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years andto slash beef prices by around 10 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>That decision, agreed in outline last December aftervirtually nine days of non-stop negotiations, was hailed as themost significant step yet in the reform offensive, but hassince run into difficulties over the fine print.</sentence>

		<sentence>The failure of the International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotascould trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of atleast 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.</sentence>
		<sentence>A special meeting between importing and exporting countriesended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talksover how to set the quotas.</sentence>
		<sentence>No further meeting to discussquotas was set, delegates said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under theInternational Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago afterprices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.</sentence>
		<sentence>With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producerselling initially and a price war among commercial coffeeroasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarketshelf this spring, coffee dealers said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer andexporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for thebreakdown of the talks.</sentence>
		<sentence>Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative anddelegate to the talks, said in a statement after the counciladjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were notprepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objectivecriteria.</sentence>
		<sentence>"We want to insure that countries receive export quotasbased on their ability to supply the market, instead of theirpolitical influence in the ICO."</sentence>
		<sentence>Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Daustercountered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried todictate quotas, not negotiate them."</sentence>
		<sentence>Previously, quotas were determined by historical amountsexported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global marketof about 58 mln 60-kilo bags.</sentence>
		<sentence>A majority of producers wantedquotas to continue under this basic scheme.</sentence>
		<sentence>But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producersproposed carving up the export market on the basis ofexportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil'sshare to 28.8 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changesin many countries' export capabilities and make coffee morereadily available to consumers when they need it.</sentence>
		<sentence>A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largestexporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interimproposal could not bring the two sides together.</sentence>
		<sentence>Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems,illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments onbank debt, have increased political pressure on the country toprotect its coffee export earnings.</sentence>
		<sentence>Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavilyon coffee earnings, particularly some African nations andColombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failureto agree quotas, analysts said.</sentence>

		<subject>NEUTRAL BUDGET EXPECTED IN SINGAPORE</subject>
		<sentence>Singapore's Finance Minister RichardHu is expected to announce a neutral budget tomorrow with nomajor tax changes for the 1987/88 year starting April 1,bankers and economists told Reuters.</sentence>
		<sentence>They said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct incalendar 1986, indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pctshrinkage in 1985, the government was likely to hold its courseand wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last March Hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct,and income tax was reduced by the same margin.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year the government also reduced wage costs byintroducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions tothe mandatory state savings scheme, the Central Provident Fund(CPF), to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct.</sentence>
		<sentence>"I don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because theeconomy is now improving," said Clemente Escano, vice presidentof the Union Bank of Switzerland.</sentence>
		<sentence>The government's economic report for calendar 1986, issuedlast week, said the CPF reduction and other cost-cuttingmeasures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the report said over half the economy -- especially thecommerce, financial, and business services sectors -- continuedto be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regionaleconomies and an excess of domestic property.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said the fragility of the economic recoverysuggested the government would not introduce much of itsplanned consumption tax in the coming financial year.</sentence>
		<sentence>In last year's budget Hu said he planned to set upcollecting machinery for the tax.</sentence>
		<sentence>Economists said a campaignagainst smoking this year might be the opportunity for him tolevy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said the government does not look likely toraise more revenue in this year's budget.</sentence>
		<sentence>Last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budgetdeficit for fiscal 1986/87, but the economic report projectedan overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment incomeand stringent controls on government operating expenditure,helped by the wage-freeze policy.</sentence>
		<sentence>Anthony K.P.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lee, vice-president and deputy general managerof American Express Bank Ltd, said he expected nothing excitingfrom this year's budget.</sentence>
		<sentence>Lee said, "It will probably be a non-event as most of thetax benefits were given last year.</sentence>
		<sentence>The economy has alreadystarted moving so it does not need government support."</sentence>
		<sentence>Last week's economic report attributed the one pct declinein domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline inprivate construction, so this sector hopes for some relief fromthe budget, economists said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The economic report said the sector's activity declined by25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985.</sentence>
		<sentence>A further decline is expected in 1987.</sentence>
		<sentence>But in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax forindustrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct untilthe end of 1988, so the most Hu is likely to do is addincentives for creating property investment unit trusts.</sentence>
		<sentence>The only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget areincentives to encourage population growth, including incentivesto families who have three children.</sentence>

		<sentence>The Federation of Bankers' Associations ofJapan released its proposal for early creation of acomprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo.</sentence>
		<sentence>The market should include a comprehensive range of futuresand options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real globalmoney centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments isavailable, the proposal said.</sentence>
		<sentence>It should provide currency and interest rate futures, andincorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stockindex futures contracts.</sentence>
		<sentence>The proposal said transactions in all these contracts mustbe conducted on the same market so participants can readilyengage in arbitrage between various financial instruments.</sentence>
		<sentence>To make this possible, the proposal calls for newlegislation which would administer all related futures andoptions transactions under the same legal framework.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banking sources said they expect that initially thecurrency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures wouldinclude Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit,three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasurybonds.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki assaying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possiblebecause it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan'sfinancial markets.</sentence>
		<sentence>Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospectivemarket participants to banks but was willing to accept thosefrom wider business circles, the sources said.</sentence>

		<sentence>Japan looks likely to allow U.S. Banks toconduct securities business here, a move that will probablycause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks frombrokerage houses to break down, financial analysts said.</sentence>

		<sentence>But if U.S. Banks win approval, Japanese banks will presshard for similiar status, since they are not allowed to conductsecurities business in the U.S.</sentence>

		<sentence>The official International Business newspaper todaypublished China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with thevisit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.</sentence>
		<sentence>"It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce itsrestrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilitiesfor them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chineseexports," the editorial said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice againstfavourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit Chinainto the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).</sentence>
		<sentence>"Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports inrecent years, control of them is still extremely strict andinfluences normal trade between the two countries," it added     The paper also printed an article by China's commercialcounsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who saidthat "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventingbilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.</sentence>

		<sentence>Protectionist behaviour, curbs ontechnology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.</sentence>

		<sentence>WhileU.S.</sentence>
		<sentence>Figures are based on country of origin.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it willhave to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend severallaws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.</sentence>
		<sentence>The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs andTrade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not bedominated or controlled by international Communism."</sentence>
		<sentence>The official said China was well aware of the laws, someof which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but thatthere is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To changethem.</sentence>
		<sentence>China has been the subject of about a dozen casesinvolving anti-dumping in the U.S.</sentence>

		<sentence>But, for the first time, China signed last week anagreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrainexports of at least two categories of steel goods, which maylead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence>Another diplomat said willingness to provide suchvoluntary export restraints would be an important issue inbilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.</sentence>
		<sentence>"China has the potential to disrupt world markets,especially in textiles.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other GATT countries will be nervousabout China in this respect.</sentence>
		<sentence>But there is a precedent for othercentralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members ofGATT but none has China's massive market potential for importsor its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.</sentence>
		<sentence>In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomedChina's interest in participating in GATT.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplishedovernight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a largeeconomy of the Chinese type," Shultz said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"China can play an important role by actively joining GATTdiscussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities andenhance market access for exports worldwide.</sentence>

		<sentence>West German banks would like Brazil to workmore closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with aview to seeking a solution to the country's debt problems,senior West German banking sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources, speaking ahead of a meeting later todaybetween Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his Westgerman counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg, also believed Brazilshould come up with a convincing economic recovery program.</sentence>
		<sentence>Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson, who met Funaro yesterday.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involvegovernments in negotiations with commercial banks onrescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt, which totals some109 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solveits problems with the banks rather than governments.</sentence>
		<sentence>Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave earlytomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg thisevening.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with theIMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to anausterity program with the Fund.</sentence>
		<sentence>However, the West German banking sources said institutionshere felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented acredible recovery program and that there be a "rapprochement"with the IMF.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Consultations are the least that can be expected," said onebanker.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago tosuspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercialdebt.</sentence>
		<sentence>It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited byforeign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs.</sentence>
		<sentence>One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debtnegotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funarofor a change in the structure of the advisory committee ofbanks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982.</sentence>
		<sentence>Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks, holding 35 pct ofBrazilian debt, were over-represented on the 14-bank advisorycommittee with 50 pct of the committee seats.</sentence>
		<sentence>He said Brazilmight adopt a different approach to its creditor banks,involving separate discussions with the regions.</sentence>
		<sentence>Such a move would be in Brazil's interest, since Europeanbanks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternativedebt solutions, such as interest capitalisation.</sentence>
		<sentence>The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regionalapproach, saying: "There must be one committee and one solution."</sentence>
		<sentence>But he added: "There must be an understanding that specialrequests from special regions be taken into account."</sentence>
		<sentence>German banks had objected to the fact that the idea ofinterest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee.</sentence>
		<sentence>Itwas imperative that alternative options be considered.</sentence>
		<sentence>"The menumust become richer," the banker said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involvedin today's talks with Funaro.</sentence>
		<sentence>A spokesman for the Bundesbank inFrankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented.</sentence>
		<sentence>West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to theBrazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions inthe United States, because of their lower exposure.</sentence>

		<subject>REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY</subject>
		<sentence>Last week's White House shake-up hasincreased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman PaulVolcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from thearms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close tothe Fed say.</sentence>
		<sentence>But they said that no decision on the appointment, whichmust be filled this August, has been taken by the White Houseand Volcker too has not made up his mind.</sentence>
		<sentence>Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, whoresigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named ashis replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and triedoften to undermine him.</sentence>
		<sentence>It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried toensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by PresidentCarter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.</sentence>
		<sentence>Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.</sentence>
		<sentence>Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked astory, quickly shot down by others in the administration, thatBeryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,had been chosen to replace Volcker.</sentence>
		<sentence>But as the administration's credibility was increasinglyunder fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring aboutsuch changes was on the wane.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said New White House Chief of Staff HowardBaker has a very good relationship with his namesake at theTreasury Department and is likely to respect his views on theFed chairmanship.</sentence>
		<sentence>As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to sharethe right-wing's opposition to Volcker.</sentence>
		<sentence>"This new White House is going to need all the strength itcan get," said one source when asked about the possibility ofVolcker's reappointment.</sentence>
		<sentence>Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets bothin the United States and around the world.</sentence>
		<sentence>At a time when thestability of the dollar and the viability of major debtornations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitelyundermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.</sentence>
		<sentence>U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with TreasurySecretary Baker on issues like international debt and globaleconomic cooperation.</sentence>
		<sentence>The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulatethe banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, inwhich he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,signalled the politically-independent central bank is comingaround at least partially to the Treasury position.</sentence>
		<sentence>And a recent statement by a Reagan administration officialthat the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seenas an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.</sentence>
		<sentence>Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker'sreappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.</sentence>
		<sentence>The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointedTreasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure agood working relationship, in part because he believed the twokey government economic institutions have to work closely.</sentence>
		<sentence>Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's firstterm, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firmMerrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America'spre-eminent economic spokesman.</sentence>
		<sentence>He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose politicalskills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets tookmuch more seriously.</sentence>
		<sentence>But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited tostay.</sentence>
		<sentence>"Is the president going to ask him?</sentence>
		<sentence>he wouldn't stayotherwise," said one.</sentence>
		<sentence>"He'd have to be asked," said StephenAxilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fedand now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.</sentence>
		<sentence>Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is notawe-inspiring.</sentence>
		<sentence>And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leavebehind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.</sentence>
		<sentence>Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --the four sitting members were all appointed within the lastthree years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the globaleconomy is threatened by instability.</sentence>
		<sentence>An experienced successor, therefore, would seem anecessity.</sentence>
		<sentence>One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary ofState George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretaryunder Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economistwould make him ideal.</sentence>
		<sentence>But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iranscandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37years old as too young for the job.</sentence>
		<sentence>Other potential candidates include economist AlanGreenspan, frequently an informal presidential economicadviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, FederalDeposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.</sentence>
		<sentence>Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged byhis patron's departure from the White House.</sentence>

		<sentence>"There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment becausethe market is well balanced and we must not lose thisopportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said.</sentence>
		<sentence>"There is still a lot of work to be done on a number ofclauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would notwelcome quota reintroduction until we have a completerenegotiation," de Vries added.</sentence>
		<sentence>With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to havefairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for theforeseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on ahand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market priceswere below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.</sentence>
